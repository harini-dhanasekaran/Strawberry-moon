As
you
read
this
section,
keep
a
written
list
of
the
items
that
apply
to
your
situation.
You
should
finish
with
a
better
picture
of
your
expected
monthly
expenses,
the
size
of
the
emergency
fund
you
need
to
have
on
hand,
and
things
best
taken
care
of
before
you
quit
your
job.
In
Part
I
of
this
book,
we
talked
about
ensuring
you
have
at
least
4
months'
living
expenses
in
the
bank
just
in
case.
We
also
talked
about
properly
factoring
in
a
higher
cost
of
health
insurance
into
that
number,
and
having
reserves
to
cover
what
may
be
a
higher
health
insurance
deductible
once
you're
on
your
own.
Health
care
is
not
the
only
cost
you
will
incur.
There
are
some
other
expenses
you'll
need
to
consider
when
you're
self-employed,
and
you
need
to
make
sure
you
have
a
plan
for
them
as
well.
For
items
that
apply
to
you,
go
back
and
update
your
business
plan
to
account
for
these
new
expenses,
and
make
sure
you�re
still
financially
comfortable
with
taking
the
leap
into
full-time
self-employment.
Once
you
have
an
idea
of
what
your
new
business
will
be,
you
should
be
able
to
estimate
these
extra
costs.
Self-employment
tax.
In
the
US,
your
employer
pays
half
of
your
social
security
and
Medicare
taxes
for
you.
When
you're
self-employed,
you're
responsible
for
paying
the
full
amount.
When
talking
to
your
accountant,
make
sure
you
understand
how
much
this
will
end
up
being.
In
many
cases,
the
additional
tax
deductions
you
can
take
as
a
business
owner
will
help
to
offset
this,
and
there
are
tax
strategies
(such
as
filing
both
as
an
S-corp
and
as
an
individual)
that
can
help
to
minimize
this
expense.
But
your
accountant
will
need
to
analyze
your
individual
situation.
Life
and
disability
insurance.
If
your
employer
offered
subsidized
life
or
disability
insurance
and
you
want
to
continue
that
coverage,
you'll
need
to
find
your
own
plan
and
pay
its
premiums
on
your
own.
Costs
will
vary
widely
depending
on
the
age
and
health
of
you
and
your
family.
Commercial
insurance.
If
you
plan
on
having
an
office
outside
of
your
home,
you
may
be
required
to
carry
insurance
for
it
�
at
minimum,
general
liability
coverage.
This
will
cost
you
several
hundreds
of
dollars
per
year,
at
a
minimum.
Office
rent.
If
working
from
your
home
or
a
coffee
shop
isn't
practical
for
some
reason,
factor
in
the
rent
for
a
local
office
into
your
budget.
Costs
vary
widely
by
region,
but
do
some
looking
around.
Something
on
the
order
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
a
month
should
be
reasonable
for
a
one
or
two
person
office.
Dental
insurance.
Dental
coverage
may
be
hard
to
find
when
you're
self-employed.
Plans
that
basically
offer
a
discount
at
participating
dentists
may
be
an
option,
but
at
any
rate
you'll
need
to
plan
to
pay
for
your
cleanings
and
any
dental
work
out
of
your
own
pocket.
If
your
kids
need
braces,
that
might
be
enough
to
keep
you
working
for
someone
else
a
little
while
longer.
If
you're
behind
on
your
cleanings
and
X-Rays,
get
those
done
before
you
lose
your
corporate
coverage!
You
don't
want
any
dental
surprises
cropping
up
in
the
first
few
months
of
self-employment.
Vision
plans.
Get
that
new
pair
of
glasses
or
contact
lenses,
and
an
eye
exam,
before
you
quit
your
day
job.
You'll
be
paying
full
price
for
these
services,
out
of
pocket,
once
you're
self-employed.
Ongoing
health
expenses.
It's
bad
enough
that
you're
probably
going
to
end
up
paying
a
ridiculously
high
health
insurance
premium
once
you're
on
your
own,
but
it's
even
worse
to
know
it
probably
won't
cover
much
of
anything.
Although
we
talked
about
having
reserves
to
cover
your
deductible
amount,
it's
easy
to
think
of
that
in
abstract
terms.
"Oh,
my
whole
family
is
healthy,
so
it's
not
likely
to
amount
to
much."
Make
sure
you're
budgeting
for
health-related
expenses
that
you
know
you'll
have.
Is
anyone
in
your
family
on
any
prescription
medication?
Are
periodic
doctor
visits
needed
to
maintain
those
prescriptions?
Do
you
have
any
durable
medical
equipment
that
needs
periodic
maintenance
or
replacement?
These
are
all
real
costs
you're
going
to
need
to
budget
for.
Before
quitting
your
day
job,
get
your
existing
doctors
to
authorize
refills
for
any
prescriptions
or
equipment
you
need
for
as
long
a
period
as
possible.
Professional
services.
What
recurring
monthly
costs
will
you
have
for
web
hosting,
accounting
software,
professional
associations,
etc.?
How
much
do
you
expect
to
spend
on
outside
help
for
legal,
accounting,
web
development,
etc.?
Be
sure
those
costs
are
all
factored
into
your
plans.
All
these
extra
expenses
sound
scary,
but
also
think
about
your
opportunities
for
extra
income.
Unlike
when
you
were
working
for
someone
else,
"moonlighting"
will
be
totally
OK
now.
Your
money
does
not
need
to
come
exclusively
from
your
new
business
at
first.
Can
you
augment
your
income
with
freelance
work
if
necessary?
Is
there
stuff
you
can
sell?
Can
you
go
fix
peoples'
computers
for
them
for
some
extra
cash?
Rent
out
a
room?
Be
a
driver?
Think
creatively
�
you
don't
have
to
do
all
of
that
stuff,
but
if
you're
just
a
little
short
on
income
at
first,
it's
good
to
have
a
list
of
things
you
can
do
to
fill
that
gap
temporarily.
So,
that's
the
first
part
�
ensure
your
projected
income
from
self-employment
will
cover
your
total
projected
expenses.
Once
you
start
devoting
a
full
time
effort
to
your
business,
you'll
be
more
likely
to
generate
additional
revenue
that
actually
improves
your
quality
of
life.
The
next
part
is
developing
your
"Plan
B"
�
if
your
business
starts
to
slow
and
you
can't
get
it
going
in
the
right
direction,
eventually
those
cash
reserves
you
had
will
start
to
diminish.
Once
you've
only
got
enough
left
to
give
you
time
to
find
another
job,
well,
you
need
to
find
another
job.
Hopefully
that
will
not
happen,
but
you
need
to
be
prepared
for
it
if
it
does.
Would
your
previous
employer
hire
you
back?
Are
there
other
employers
locally
who
would
want
you?
Are
there
employers
who
would
hire
you
remotely?
If
so,
then
you'll
be
fine.
Think
about
this
concretely,
however.
What
companies
would
you
apply
to?
Are
you
sure
they
are
hiring
people
like
you
right
now?
Is
your
experience
competitive
with
other
applicants
for
these
jobs?
Is
the
experience
you'll
gain
by
trying
out
your
new
business
relevant
to
these
jobs,
or
will
this
time
just
be
viewed
as
a
gap
in
your
employment?
If
you're
not
confident
in
your
ability
to
find
another
job,
then
plan
to
change
your
situation.
Should
you
consider
moving
to
a
new
city
where
jobs
are
more
plentiful,
just
in
case?
If
you
engineered
your
new
business
to
give
you
the
freedom
to
work
where
you
want,
then
that
is
an
option.
Or,
you
can
tuck
away
another
emergency
fund
that
allows
you
to
move
only
if
needed
later
on.
Can
you
use
your
self-employment
to
provide
real-world
training
in
skills
that
are
more
marketable?
Maybe
instead
of
farming
out
your
website
development,
you
plan
to
do
it
yourself
in
order
to
learn
more
about
it,
for
example.
If
your
skills
are
in
wide
demand,
you
can
also
use
that
to
your
advantage
while
you
are
self-employed.
Can
you
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
move
someplace
with
a
lower
cost
of
living,
and
perhaps
even
a
better
climate?
If
so,
the
amount
of
profit
your
company
needs
to
generate
could
be
lowered
in
the
long
run
�
as
long
as
you
still
live
someplace
where
your
skills
are
in
demand.
In
my
own
example,
I
moved
from
Seattle,
a
place
with
a
high
cost
of
living,
to
Orlando,
where
housing
can
be
had
at
half
the
cost�
but
there
are
still
many
tech
companies
in
Orlando
with
a
dire
need
for
experienced
software
developers,
should
I
need
to
get
a
job
again.
This
was
all
part
of
my
initial
planning
before
I
turned
in
my
resignation.
Beyond
your
backup
plans,
one
other
thing
to
think
about
is
your
personal
credit,
and
how
self-employment
will
affect
it.
As
long
as
you
continue
to
pay
your
bills
on
time,
your
actual
credit
score
won't
suffer.
But,
you're
going
to
be
hard-pressed
to
get
a
new
mortgage
or
a
major
new
loan
when
you
don't
have
a
traditional
job,
and
you
haven't
been
successfully
self-employed
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years.
If
you
need
to
get
a
new
auto
loan
or
lease,
or
buy
a
new
house,
it's
going
to
be
a
lot
easier
to
do
that
before
you
quit
your
day
job.
In
my
case,
I
bought
my
new
house
in
Florida
as
a
"second
home"
before
turning
in
my
notice,
and
I
also
purchased
a
new
car
from
an
Orlando
dealership
that
would
be
waiting
for
us
when
we
got
there.
Had
I
waited
until
after
quitting,
that
may
have
been
impossible.
Working
out
a
relocation
at
the
same
time
as
this
career
change
can
be
tricky,
but
it
can
be
done.
Taking
on
new
debt
at
a
time
like
this
may
sound
crazy,
but
as
long
as
you're
disposing
of
higher
levels
of
monthly
payments
at
the
same
time
(by
selling
your
old
house
and
car),
it's
a
win.
Think
about
anything
coming
up
in
the
foreseeable
future
where
the
credit
and
benefits
you
have
as
a
traditional,
full-time
employee
are
valuable
�
and
plan
to
exercise
those
benefits
before
you
quit.
I've
given
you
a
lot
to
be
afraid
of
in
this
section,
but
my
intention
is
only
to
ensure
that
you
have
planned
for
the
realities
of
self-employment
and
have
contingency
plans
you
can
execute
when
necessary.

I
want
you
to
enter
self-employment
prepared
for
the
worst
and
without
fear,
so
you
can
focus
instead
on
its
many
positive
aspects.
YOU
DON'T
HAVE
TO
GO
IT
ALONE
Transitioning
from
a
life
of
working
for
a
big
company
to
a
life
of
working
for
yourself
isn't
easy.
It
will
take
years
before
you're
completely
comfortable
with
it
and
shake
off
your
old
habits.
But,
you
don't
have
to
go
it
alone.
In
fact,
it's
imperative
that
you
are
willing
to
learn
and
be
coached
by
others.
Odds
are
you
know
someone
who
has
done
what
you're
considering
to
do,
and
can
go
buy
that
person
a
beer
to
hear
more
about
how
they
did
it.
Make
a
list
of
things
you
want
to
ask
about
to
make
sure
you
make
the
best
use
of
that
time,
but
give
them
time
to
just
tell
you
their
story
as
well.
At
this
stage,
part
of
what
you're
learning
is
what
questions
to
be
asking
in
the
first
place.
Even
if
you
don't
know
someone
personally,
you
should
be
able
to
think
of
CEO's
of
small
companies
similar
to
the
one
you're
going
to
start.
People
who
have
successfully
made
the
transition
to
self-employment
love
nothing
more
than
trying
to
help
other
people
do
the
same
thing.
We
want
everyone
to
realize
how
much
of
themselves
they
are
giving
up
by
working
for
other
people,
and
replicate
the
lifestyle
we've
managed
to
create.
That's
why
I'm
writing
this
book.
You
might
be
surprised
who
will
talk
to
you
about
it,
if
you
just
ask.
When
I
was
starting
out,
I
reached
out
to
the
CEO's
of
several
successful
companies
(ones
that
I
would
not
be
directly
competing
with)
just
asking
for
a
half
hour
of
their
time
to
learn
more
about
how
they
did
it,
and
any
advice
they
might
have
for
someone
embarking
on
a
similar
path.
Every
single
one
of
them
was
more
than
happy
to
talk
to
me,
which
frankly
amazed
me.
A
lot
of
what
they
told
me
didn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
at
the
time,
since
I
wasn't
yet
immersed
in
an
entrepreneurial
state
of
mind.
But
I
took
detailed
notes,
and
revisited
them
as
I
learned
more
about
running
my
own
business.
Over
the
course
of
a
year,
their
advice
started
to
make
more
and
more
sense
�
and
became
more
and
more
valuable.
You
should
also
see
if
your
city
has
a
government-funded
business
incubation
program,
or
economic
development
commission.
Local
governments
are
usually
the
ones
keen
on
fostering
new
business
creation
within
their
cities,
and
often
they
have
programs
in
place
to
help
new
business
owners
to
get
started.
Here
in
Orlando,
I
am
part
of
the
University
of
Central
Florida
business
incubation
program.
For
a
low
monthly
cost,
I've
received
free
consultations
with
web
designers,
accountants,
lawyers,
government
contracting
officials,
and
an
entire
course
on
entrepreneurship
�
along
with
an
office
and
meeting
space
when
I
need
it.
It's
pretty
common
for
people
to
enter
this
program
before
they
have
quit
their
day
job,
and
get
some
extra
education
on
successful
entrepreneurship
before
taking
the
plunge.
If
your
locale
has
similar
resources,
I
encourage
you
to
explore
them.
They
can
even
connect
you
with
local
angel
investors.
Although
I
do
recommend
proceeding
with
caution
before
accepting
investments
of
any
sort,
in
my
case
these
investors
were
interested
enough
in
what
I
was
doing
to
just
meet
over
coffee
and
give
me
some
free
advice,
even
though
I
didn't
want
their
money.
Check
out
meetup.com
�
there
are
probably
several
groups
of
local
entrepreneurs
and
self-employed
individuals
who
meet
regularly
to
exchange
notes,
and
they'll
be
happy
to
help
you
get
started.
Perhaps
your
location
or
specific
business
makes
online
resources
a
better
choice;
right
now,
American
Express�s
OPEN
forum
seems
to
provide
the
most
useful
community
of
small
business
owners
that
I�ve
seen.
You
can
check
it
out
at
http://www.openforum.com.
There
are
things
to
watch
out
for,
however.
Everyone
you
encounter
who
has
been
successful
with
self-employment
is
going
to
want
to
talk
to
you
about
it
and
give
you
advice.
But
the
more
people
you
talk
to,
the
more
you'll
start
to
realize
that
much
of
their
advice
contradicts
one
another.
Everyone's
path
is
a
little
different,
and
what
worked
for
someone
else's
business
might
not
be
relevant
to
yours.
For
example,
in
the
early
days
of
my
business,
I
received
a
lot
of
advice
about
sales
techniques
�
but
these
were
from
people
doing
business
only
in
our
local
area.
My
global,
Internet-based
business
did
not
benefit
from
these
techniques,
and
ultimately
it
proved
to
just
be
a
distraction.
The
people
who
started
businesses
similar
to
my
own
provided
the
best
advice
in
the
long
run.
When
listening
to
advice
from
successful
people,
don't
assume
it
is
all
gospel
�
weigh
their
advice
against
the
similarity
of
their
businesses
to
your
own.
Also,
be
aware
that
there
are
people
out
there
who
prey
on
new
business
owners
who
don't
know
what
they
are
doing
yet.
If
anyone
wants
to
help
you
in
exchange
for
a
percentage
of
your
business,
distance
yourself
from
that
person
as
quickly
as
possible.
I've
heard
lots
of
horror
stories
about
people
handing
over
some
ownership
of
their
business
to
a
board
of
advisors,
or
even
worse
a
partner,
who
promptly
disappears
as
soon
as
you've
signed
over
a
portion
of
your
business
to
them.
There
should
be
no
shortage
of
people
willing
to
help
you
for
free.
If
you
really,
really
want
to
give
up
some
ownership
of
your
company
for
some
bizarre
reason,
make
sure
any
agreement
is
drafted
by
your
own
lawyer
and
is
explicit
about
what
they
are
expected
to
do
in
order
to
retain
that
ownership
stake.
Your
lawyer
will
hopefully
talk
some
sense
into
you
at
this
point,
anyhow.
And
always
ensure
you
retain
a
majority
stake
in
your
business
�
it�s
not
uncommon
for
a
board
to
fire
its
founder
and
CEO,
leaving
you
fired
from
your
own
business.
A
lifestyle
business
should
be
100%
owned
by
you,
really.


PULLING
THE
TRIGGER
If
you've
done
everything
we've
talked
about
so
far,
it's
time
to
start
thinking
about
turning
in
your
notice.
Here's
a
checklist
to
remind
you
of
the
things
you
need
to
do
before
saying
"I
must
tender
my
resignation."
YOUR
FINAL
CHECKLIST
___
I
have
launched
my
business
to
a
test
market,
and
believe
it
now
has
the
potential
to
pay
for
my
living
expenses
based
on
the
sales
data
I
gathered.
___
I
have
a
business
plan
for
expanding
that
launch
and
for
future
product
development.
I
have
an
idea
on
how
to
keep
growing
my
business
once
I
can
give
it
my
full
time
attention.
I
have
a
marketing
plan
in
place.
___
I
have
ensured
I
have
any
patents,
trademarks,
and
copyrights
filed
that
I
need.
___
I
have
ensured
to
the
best
of
my
ability
that
I
am
not
infringing
on
any
patents,
trademarks,
or
copyrights
with
my
new
business.
___
I
understand
my
expected
monthly
expenses
as
a
self-employed
individual,
and
I
have
enough
reserves
saved
up
to
cover
at
least
3
months
in
addition
to
the
time
I
expect
it
would
take
to
get
a
new
job.
___
I
have
a
backup
plan
that
I
can
execute
the
moment
I
burn
through
those
cash
reserves,
if
necessary.
___
I
understand
my
options
for
obtaining
health
insurance
after
I
leave
my
job
and
what
it
will
cost.
I
have
a
plan
for
dealing
with
deductibles.
___
I
know
what
other
benefits
I
will
lose,
such
as
life,
dental,
or
vision
insurance,
and
have
a
plan
to
replace
them
or
go
without.
___
I
have
the
necessary
business
licenses
at
the
state,
county,
and
local
levels.
___
I
have
opened
a
bank
account
for
my
new
business.
___
I
have
met
with
an
accountant,
and
understand
my
new
responsibilities
for
taxes
and
accounting.
___
I
have
met
with
and
selected
a
lawyer
that
specializes
in
small
businesses.
___
I
have
explored
local
community
resources
for
new
business
owners
that
can
help
me
get
started
___
I
have
taken
full
advantage
of
my
employment
benefits
before
I
lose
them;
my
family
is
up
to
date
on
checkups,
dental
exams,
eye
exams,
getting
new
glasses,
etc.
My
prescriptions
are
refilled
for
as
far
in
the
future
as
possible.
___
I
have
taken
full
advantage
of
my
personal
credit
before
I
lose
it;
any
large
purchases
that
require
a
loan
in
the
next
couple
of
years
have
already
been
finalized.
___
I've
connected
to
anyone
I
might
want
to
stay
in
touch
with
via
my
personal
social
networks.
___
I
do
not
have
any
equipment
owned
by
my
employer
at
home
that
they'll
need
to
collect
later.
___
I've
collected
any
personal
information,
and
most
of
my
personal
belongings
that
are
in
the
office
and
brought
them
home.
You
shouldn't
have
anything
personal
in
nature
on
your
work
computer,
but
if
you
do,
delete
it.
If
you
honestly
have
all
of
those
ducks
in
a
row,
then
it's
time
to
do
the
most
scary
thing
you've
done
in
a
long
time
�

quit
your
job,
without
having
another
one
lined
up
first.
TELLING
YOUR
BOSS
I
cannot
stress
enough
how
important
it
is
to
not
burn
your
bridges.
There's
a
good
chance
your
venture
won't
work
out,
and
the
best
case
scenario
is
that
your
former
employer
welcomes
you
back
with
open
arms
if
that
happens.
You'll
have
grown
and
learned
a
lot
having
gone
through
that
adventure,
and
hopefully
your
employer
appreciates
that
you'll
come
back
as
a
better
employee
should
that
happen.
I
will
also
restate
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
separation
between
your
side
business
and
your
day
job
leading
up
to
this
point.
Your
performance
in
your
day
job
must
not
suffer
while
you're
experimenting
with
your
own
business,
or
you'll
have
burned
that
bridge
before
you
even
turn
in
your
notice.
It's
pretty
common
for
someone
in
the
tech
industry
to
quit
in
order
to
try
working
for
themselves,
or
to
launch
their
own
startup.
I
think
most
managers
understand
the
appeal
of
trying
that
out
if
you're
in
a
position
to
do
so,
and
usually
there
will
be
no
hard
feelings
about
It.
As
far
as
the
actual
conversation
goes,
ask
for
some
private
time
with
your
boss.
They
usually
know
what
that
means,
so
they
won't
be
too
surprised
by
what
you
have
to
say.
You
should
be
honest,
but
you
don't
have
to
tell
them
everything,
either.
Tell
them
you
have
a
new
business
idea
that
doesn't
compete
with
your
company,
and
you
want
to
give
it
a
try
while
you're
in
a
position
to
do
so.
You
don't
have
to
talk
about
all
the
work
you've
done
on
the
side
leading
up
to
this
moment.
Remain
upbeat
throughout
the
conversation
and
excited
about
the
new
adventure
you're
about
to
embark
upon.
Even
if
you're
not
happy
with
your
job,
this
is
not
the
time
to
talk
about
that.
If
you're
self-motivated
enough
to
have
gotten
this
far,
odds
are
you've
been
a
really
good
worker
for
your
company
too.
They
may
dangle
incentives
in
front
of
you
to
try
and
retain
you.
It's
up
to
you,
but
bear
in
mind
your
company
doesn't
want
any
pay
inequities
in
the
long
run,
so
extra
pay
or
retention
bonuses
you
might
accept
now
may
affect
your
ability
to
get
additional
raises
or
bonuses
in
the
future.
And
your
boss
will
always
be
wondering
if
you're
still
dreaming
about
leaving.
You
also
don't
want
to
be
perceived
as
someone
who's
primarily
motivated
by
money,
right
or
wrong.
They
may
try
to
scare
you
out
of
leaving,
by
throwing
around
statistics
about
how
many
new
businesses
fail.
If
you've
really
read
this
book
up
to
this
point,
you
already
understand
what
you're
getting
yourself
into.
If
they
genuinely
have
new
information
to
offer
you,
by
all
means
listen.
But
remember
their
agenda
is
simply
to
avoid
having
to
replace
you.
Once
your
company
has
accepted
your
resignation,
you
may
be
shocked
at
how
quickly
the
company
you've
been
so
dedicated
and
loyal
to
for
so
many
years
can
turn
on
you.

It
drives
home
how
unidirectional
that
loyalty
really
was.
Some
companies
will
escort
you
straight
to
your
desk
with
a
box
to
gather
your
belongings
and
unceremoniously
walk
you
out
the
door
accompanied
by
a
security
guard.
Depending
on
your
job,
you
may
get
a
stern
lecture
from
a
lawyer
about
upholding
your
end
of
the
confidentiality
and
non-compete
agreements
you
signed.
My
own
employer
spared
me
those
indignities,
but
I
saw
them
applied
to
others.
Leaving
your
job
will
trigger
a
whirlwind,
but
among
the
chaos
be
sure
to
wrap
up
a
few
things
before
they
lock
you
out
of
the
office:
*
If
you
will
be
moving,
make
sure
human
resources
has
your
new
address.
You
want
to
make
sure
you
receive
your
last
paycheck,
tax
forms,
and
a
certificate
of
prior
coverage
for
your
health
insurance.
Make
sure
they
have
your
personal
email
address
on
file
in
case
they
need
to
contact
you.
*
If
your
health
plan
included
a
H.S.A.
(health
savings
account,)
make
sure
you
know
how
to
get
your
money
out
of
it.
You
won't
get
it
back
automatically;
if
you
do
nothing,
the
account
provider
will
just
bleed
that
account
dry
over
time
with
monthly
fees
until
it's
gone.
*
Accept
their
paperwork
for
COBRA
coverage
to
continue
your
health
insurance,
but
you
probably
want
to
get
a
plan
through
healthcare.gov
or
your
state
exchange
instead
as
soon
as
you
get
home.
Compare
the
cost
of
COBRA
coverage
and
how
long
it
lasts
to
what
you
could
find
on
the
exchange.
*
Make
sure
you
have
all
of
your
personal
belongings
�
getting
back
in
later
may
be
difficult
or
impossible.
*
Make
sure
you
don't
have
any
company
equipment
at
home.
*
Don't
sign
anything
if
you
don't
know
what
it
is.
*
If
you
have
an
exit
interview,
don't
use
that
as
an
opportunity
to
vent
about
all
of
the
frustrations
you've
had
at
work
over
the
years.
Leave
on
good
terms,
and
remain
professional
and
friendly
throughout
the
exit
process.
Leaving
to
start
your
own
business
is
a
much
more
forgivable
thing
than
leaving
to
work
for
a
competitor.
Try
to
leave
on
as
good
terms
as
possible,
as
you
never
know
if
you'll
have
to
come
back.
Maybe
you
can
even
do
some
contract
work
for
them
after
you've
left,
and
end
up
earning
more
from
them
than
when
you
were
an
employee!
Even
after
leaving,
never
say
anything
bad
about
your
former
employer.


PART
III:
MAKING
IT
LAST




You
just
came
home
with
a
cardboard
box
full
of
your
personal
belongings,
having
left
your
office
for
the
last
time.
It
feels
weird.
But
remember,
you're
not
unemployed
now
�
you�re
self-employed.
You
are
now
at
a
turning
point
in
your
life.
You
might
never
have
to
commute
into
work
again.
You
may
be
able
to
do
whatever
you
want
from
now
on,
both
professionally
and
personally.
Soon,
you
may
be
able
to
live
wherever
you
want.
No
more
unproductive
meetings.
No
more
set
working
hours
or
artificially-set
deadlines
from
above.
No
more
appeasing
executives,
and
fearing
to
protect
your
reputation
and
advancement
opportunities
at
work.
No
more
office
politics.
But
�
no
more
paycheck!
You
are
now
on
your
own,
and
your
ability
to
sustain
this
lifestyle
depends
on
your
ability
to
quickly
grow
what
was
your
side
business,
and
sustain
that
growth
long
term.
It
sounds
hard,
but
your
survival
instinct
will
ensure
you
give
this
your
best
effort.
You'll
be
amazed
at
what
you
can
do
when
you
have
to.
This
final
section
of
the
book
covers
some
tips
I've
learned
to
help
fuel
that
growth.
It
might
not
all
apply
to
your
business,
but
take
whatever
bits
you
can.
It
might
help
you
make
this
new
lifestyle
a
permanent
one.


FUELING
THE
FIRE
If
you
haven't
already,
now's
the
time
to
fully
launch
whatever
product
or
service
offering
you
have.
Your
business
is
not
a
secret
any
longer,
and
you
can
dedicate
your
full
time
effort
to
the
launch.
How
you
launch
your
business
is
just
as
important
as
the
quality
of
your
offering!
It's
not
enough
to
build
a
great
product.
You'll
need
to
quickly
understand
how
to
market
and
sell
it;
you
need
to
get
it
in
front
of
potential
customers,
and
grabbing
their
attention
is
getting
harder
all
the
time.
If
you
can
successfully
wrap
your
head
around
the
basics
of
PR,
sales,
and
marketing
however
�
you�ll
have
a
huge
advantage
over
the
other
self-employed
individuals
who
only
do
the
bare
minimum
to
get
exposure
for
their
business.
Remember,
PR,
sales,
and
marketing
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
your
job
as
product
development
and
customer
support
now.
If
you
find
yourself
shying
away
from
these
new
disciplines,
you
need
to
schedule
time
for
yourself
to
dedicate
to
them
every
week
�
or
contract
others
to
help,
if
you
have
the
funds
to
do
so
and
a
plan
to
measure
their
effectiveness.
BUILDING
YOUR
WEBSITE
I
can't
teach
you
how
to
build
a
website
in
this
book.
But
I
can
give
you
some
advice
on
having
someone
else
build
it
for
you,
if
it's
not
something
you
can
do
yourself.
Unless
you
are
a
professional
web
designer,
I
really
think
this
is
one
area
where
it's
worth
hiring
someone
to
do
the
initial
work
for
you.
Your
website
may
be
the
cornerstone
of
your
marketing
efforts,
and
it's
important
to
make
sure
it
attracts
customers
instead
of
repelling
them.
This
can
run
you
thousands
of
dollars
depending
on
the
complexity
of
your
website,
so
it's
best
to
get
this
set
up
before
you
quit
your
day
job
if
you
can.
In
some
situations,
you
might
not
even
need
a
website
at
all.
If
you
plan
to
sell
items
through
other
storefronts
such
as
Amazon,
Etsy,
or
EBay,
nobody
cares
about
your
website.
I
know
some
businesses
that
rely
entirely
on
personal
referrals
for
their
business,
and
only
maintain
social
network
profiles
to
market
themselves.
If
you
can
get
by
without
a
website,
then
that's
a
lot
of
expense
and
maintenance
you
can
avoid.
You
are
giving
up
some
potential
marketing
channels,
however,
if
you
don't
have
some
sort
of
web
page
to
direct
potential
customers
to.
At
least
think
about
how
important
your
website
will
be
for
your
business,
and
budget
for
it
accordingly.
If
you
do
need
a
professionally
designed
site,
start
by
identifying
companies
similar
to
yours
that
are
successful,
that
have
websites
you
consider
to
be
modern.
The
definition
of
"modern"
changes
too
quickly
for
me
to
immortalize
it
in
a
book,
but
at
this
moment
in
2015
it
means
sites
that
rely
heavily
on
large
images
that
adapt
seamlessly
to
mobile
and
tablet
devices.
Conventional
wisdom
is
that
people
don't
read
anymore,
and
you
have
about
5
seconds
to
capture
their
attention
on
your
website.
Once
you've
found
a
website
you'd
like
to
emulate,
see
if
you
can
find
in
the
credits
who
built
it.
If
you're
lucky,
this
company
also
contracted
it
out,
and
you
can
just
use
the
same
people.
If
not,
keep
looking.
Try
to
focus
on
websites
for
small
businesses
like
your
own.
They
are
also
on
a
shoestring
budget,
and
probably
used
someone
with
reasonable
prices.
Once
you've
reached
out
to
a
few
potential
web
developers,
there
is
more
to
consider
than
just
the
quality
of
their
final
products.
*
Is
the
website
maintainable
by
the
business
owner,
or
do
you
need
to
pay
the
designer
every
time
you
want
to
change
something?
*
Is
there
at
least
a
blog
you
can
update
yourself
without
involving
them?
For
search
engine
optimization
(SEO)
purposes,
it's
important
to
create
new
content
on
your
site
on
a
regular
basis.
If
your
website
doesn't
make
it
easy
for
you
to
do,
that's
a
problem.
*
What
are
they
doing
for
SEO?
Ask
them,
and
compare
their
answers.
*
What
are
they
doing
for
Landing
Page
Optimization
(LPO?)
This
is
the
art
of
designing
a
page
that
you
direct
potential
customers
to,
that
drives
them
to
perform
one
specific
action
once
they
reach
it.
Do
they
have
conversion
rate
metrics
available
from
their
other
sites
that
you
can
compare
to
others?
If
they've
never
heard
of
LPO,
that's
a
bad
sign.
*
What
are
they
doing
for
mobile?
Are
their
sites
"responsive"?
*
Will
the
website
they
deliver
be
integrated
into
Google
Analytics
or
a
similar
metrics
platform?
*
Can
they
offer
any
help
you
might
need
in
securing
reliable
web
hosting
and
domain
names
for
your
site?
A
huge
plus
is
if
the
website
they
deliver
is
created
in
WordPress,
or
some
similar
content
management
system.
This
makes
it
easy
for
you
to
extend
and
modify
the
website
yourself
later
on,
and
there
is
also
a
huge
library
of
plugins
for
WordPress
that
will
make
it
easy
to
evolve
your
website's
technical
capabilities
over
time.
When
working
with
your
web
designer,
be
very
explicit
about
what
you
want.
Provide
them
with
sketches
of
what
you
want,
the
site
navigation
you
have
in
mind,
what
pages
you
need,
examples
of
other
websites
you
like,
whatever
you
can.
They
can't
read
your
mind.
Make
sure
wireframes
of
your
new
site
are
approved
by
you
before
development
starts,
and
don't
take
that
approval
lightly
�
changing
your
mind
later
on
will
cost
you,
literally.
Listen
to
their
recommendations
and
adjust
your
designs
if
appropriate,
but
be
clear
on
what
they
are
building
before
they
start.
Poor
communication
will
result
in
expensive
misunderstandings.
Consider
making
your
website
just
one
big
page
with
a
big
image
on
top
with
a
clear
"call
to
action"
as
to
what
you
want
your
website
visitors
to
do,
and
more
details
as
you
scroll
down
�

that
seems
to
be
the
trend
lately,
and
it
can
also
keep
your
website
development
expenses
down.
The
tradeoff
is
that
SEO
is
challenging
on
such
sites,
due
to
their
limited
and
fairly
static
content.
Once
you
have
your
website
launched,
you
need
to
help
people
find
it.
That's
where
public
relations
and
marketing
comes
in.
BASICS
OF
PUBLIC
RELATIONS
The
goal
of
public
relations
is
to
gain
media
coverage
for
your
new
business
and
products.
The
first
step
is
to
write
a
press
release
announcing
your
launch.
Be
sure
to
write
this
from
the
standpoint
of
what
your
customers
would
find
interesting.
What
problem
are
you
solving
for
them?
Focus
on
that.
Press
releases
have
a
specific
format:
Attention-Grabbing
Headline
Geared
Toward
Your
Customer
CITY,
State
(Month,
Day
Year)
--
Cover
the
who,
what,
where,
why,
and
how
in
your
first
paragraph.
Remember
most
people
won't
read
past
this
point,
so
make
it
as
catchy
as
possible.
Describe
the
product
a
bit
here
and
explain
how
it
solves
a
problem
for
your
customer.
Insert
a
quote
here
from
you
and/or
a
customer
talking
about
your
news,
and
why
it
is
important
and/or
interesting.
Talk
a
little
more
about
your
news
item,
and
close
with
how
customers
can
purchase
your
products
or
services.

About
(Your

Have
a
one-paragraph
blurb
about
your
company
history
and
its
mission
that
you
use
at
the
end
of
all
of
your
press
releases.
For
the
sake
of
example,
here's
one
of
my
own
press
releases.
The
business
incubator
I'm
affiliated
with
offers
professional
copywriting
services
for
press
releases
and
complimentary
distribution,
and
so
this
was
created
with
their
help.
Unless
you
have

it's
a
good
idea
to
take
advantage
of
similar

if
they
are
available

you.

Realistic
3-D

Oceans
and

ORLANDO,

(December
19,
2014)
--
Sundog
Software,
which
developed
the
Triton
Ocean
SDK
software
library
to
power
military
software
by
depicting
ocean
wave
and
current
action
with
startlingly
realistic
clarity,
has
just
released
a
gaming
version
for
the
Oculus
Rift
3-D
VR
gaming
headset.
Frank
Kane,
founder
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Sundog
Software,
said
the
firm
teamed
up
with
AgileSrc,
LLC
in
Orlando
to
create
the
newest
version
of
Triton
Ocean
SDK
software.
�The
Oculus
Rift
headset
allows
the
user
to
turn
360
degrees
to
see
everything
that
is
created
in
a
game�s
virtual
world,�
Kane
said.
�That
presented
certain
opportunities
for
us
and,
with
the
aid
of
AgileSrc,
we
adapted
Triton
Ocean
SDK
to
create
a
whole
new
level
of
realism
when
it
comes
to
oceans,
lakes,
and
seas,�
Kane
said.

Sundog
Software�s
Triton
Ocean
SDK,
distributed
worldwide,
is
already
a
mainstay
in
training
simulator
software
for
naval
and
air
forces.
Triton
Ocean
SDK
depicts
ocean
wave
and
current
action
that
is
so
realistic
that
Kane
worries
some
users
will
feel
seasick.

�Water
surfaces
don�t
behave
symmetrically,
yet
there
are
patterns
that
seem
symmetrical
and
they
all
interact,�
Kane
said.
�Depicting
them
realistically
was
a
challenge,
but
Triton
Ocean
SDK
manages
to
coordinate
the
chaos
of
the
ocean
in
a
way
that
users
find
extremely
realistic,�
he
said.

Kane
said
Sundog
Software�s
Triton
Ocean
SDK
for
Oculus
Rift
on
the
Unity
platform
is
available
for
sale
immediately.

One
quick
side
note:
the
information
underneath
the
three
stars
or
dashes
is
only
for
the
editors
to
see;
it
will
not
be
published.
That�s
why
I
obscured
my
personal
telephone
number.

If
possible,
you
should
include
the
preferred
way
for
customers
to
learn
more
about
your
product
in
the
body
of
the
press
release
instead.
Think
about
the
forms
of
communication
your
customers
prefer;
if
they
do
talk
on
the
phone,
perhaps
listing
a
phone
number
is
appropriate.
For
my
business,
it�s
much
more
efficient
for
everyone
to
use
email,
so
that�s
the
form
of
communication
my
website
steers
people
toward.
It's
important
to
understand
who
you're
trying
to
reach
with
your
press
release.
In
my
case,
my
potential
customers
are
highly
technical
�
but
the
editors
I'm
trying
to
get
past
are
not.
So,
most
of
this
press
release
can
be
understood
be
someone
with
a
cursory
understanding
of
the
technology
being
discussed
�

but
I
made
sure
enough
technical
details
were
included
inside
the
press
release
to
appeal
to
the
engineers
I'm
trying
to
reach.
Sometimes
you
will
want
to
create
different
versions
of
the
same
press
release
for
different
audiences.
I
have
crafted
press
releases
intended
for
mass
media
coverage
that
have
no
technical
jargon
at
all,
press
releases
targeted
to
video
game
developers,
and
press
releases
targeted
to
people
developing
flight
or
maritime
training
simulators
all
for
the
same
announcement.
Customizing
the
press
release
to
fit
the
publications
you
are
submitting
it
to
can
only
help.
Avoid
hyperbole
in
your
press
release;
remember
journalists
are
supposed
to
be
objective,
so
writing
about
how
your
product
is
the
best
thing
ever
and
how
it
will
change
the
world
without
concrete
substantiation
is
not
OK.
It's
expected
that
you'll
toot
your
own
horn
a
little
bit
in
a
product
announcement
press
release,
but
try
and
stick
to
the
facts.
Once
you've
written
your
press
release,
proofread
it
and
double
check
for
any
errors.
The
next
problem
is
distributing
it.
Your
goals
are
twofold:
get
some
media
placement
that
generates
interest
in
your
company,
and
get
some
search
engine
optimization
benefits
by
getting
links
to
your
website
on
other
websites.
The
more
people
are
talking
about
your
website
across
the
web,
the
more
likely
your
website
is
to
come
up
in
search
results
when
potential
customers
are
looking
for
something
like
your
product.
Using
a
press
release
submission
service
will
probably
not
achieve
either
of
those
goals.
Your
press
release
will
end
up
in
a
huge
pile
of
others
for
a
given
broad
category
of
businesses,
or
for
a
geographical
region.
Unless
what
you
are
doing
is
truly
newsworthy
and
somehow
your
headline
catches
the
attention
of
an
editor,
it
will
be
ignored.
Some
websites
will
pick
up
and
publish
any
press
release
that
comes
out,
but
Google
knows
about
them.
These
links
will
not
improve
your
search
engine
placements.
Instead,
you
need
to
find
contact
information
for
the
handful
of
publications
that
might
be
genuinely
interested
in
your
press
release.
Your
local
newspaper
might
want
to
highlight
a
local
business.
Industry-specific
publications
are
usually
a
safe
bet,
especially
if
your
press
release
is
accompanied
by
an
image
they
can
use
in
their
publication.
Contact
information
for
their
editorial
staff
is
usually
available
at
their
website
or
within
the
publication
itself.
If
you
do
include
images
with
your
press
release,
make
sure
they
are
at
300
DPI
(dots
per
inch),
in
a
non-compressed
image
format
such
as
PNG,
and
large
enough
to
span
across
a
printed
page
at
300
DPI.
Even
more
valuable
are
industry-specific
news
sites.
Most
will
have
online
forms
for
submitting
news.
Again,
you
may
want
to
tailor
your
message
for
each
specific
site.
If
there
is
a
specific
thing
this
site
covers,
be
sure
to
mention
how
your
news
item
is
related
to
it
in
the
headline.
Look
at
other
news
articles
on
the
site,
and
make
sure
your
style
and
format
is
similar
�
instead
of
a
formal
press
release,
an
informal
one
or
two
paragraph
summary
with
a
link
to
the
press
release
(hosted
on
your
website)
may
be
more
appropriate.
The
general
idea
is
to
find
the
websites
and
publications
that
cater
to
the
particular
niche
you
are
marketing
your
product
to,
and
craft
a
message
that's
relevant
to
each
one.
Generally
speaking,
there
is
no
equivalent
to
a
cover
letter
or
introductory
text
that
accompanies
your
press
release.
Editors
don�t
have
time
to
read
such
things;
your
press
release
should
stand
on
its
own
merit,
and
it
includes
your
contact
information
should
they
have
questions.
I
generally
just
email
them
to
individual
editors
with
the
press
release
as
the
body
of
the
message,
and
a
subject
line
that
starts
with
�PR:�
followed
by
the
headline.
If
you
have
a
print-quality
image
or
two
to
include
with
the
release,
just
attach
them.
The
beauty
of
press
releases
is
that
they
are
free!
It
only
costs
your
time
to
identify
the
channels
you
want
to
push
your
message
to,
and
craft
a
message
that
they
will
be
likely
to
pick
up.
Be
prepared
however
for
salespeople
to
try
and
sell
you
paid
advertising
from
these
same
publications.
Usually
the
pitch
is
"Good
news!
We're
going
to
publish
your
press
release
in
our
next
issue.
Wouldn't
you
like
to
accompany
that
coverage
with
an
ad?
I
can
offer
you
a
first-time
discount..."
We'll
cover
that
later
under
marketing;
sometimes
it's
worthwhile
to
do
so,
and
although
most
editors
would
never
admit
it
publicly,
I've
found
that
publications
and
websites
you
advertise
on
are
much
more
likely
to
publish
your
press
releases.
Press
releases
can
also
help
to
establish
a
relationship
with
the
editors
of
the
publications
that
cater
to
your
niche.
Once
they
know
who
you
are,
they
might
consider
you
to
be
an
industry
expert
on
whatever
your
company
is
about,
which
means
you
might
get
interviewed
for
a
future
article�
leading
to
more
free
publicity
for
your
company.
Don't
just
wait
for
it
to
happen,
however.
If
you
do
receive
a
follow-up
message
from
an
editor
in
response
to
your
news
submission,
be
sure
the
mention
in
your
reply
that
you
know
a
lot
about
some
topic
of
general
issue
to
their
readership,
and
you'd
be
happy
to
provide
interview
responses
for
future
articles.
There
are
even
websites
that
specialize
in
connecting
reporters
with
industry
experts,
such
as
helpareporter.com,
although
I
can't
speak
to
their
effectiveness.
Far
better
is
to
have
a
relationship
with
the
editors
of
the
publications
most
relevant
to
your
business.
I'm
often
quoted
alongside
representatives
of
billion-dollar
companies
in
the
industry
press
as
a
result
of
my
PR
work,
which
not
only
keeps
awareness
of
my
company
up,
but
makes
my
company
seem
much
bigger
than
it
really
is.
Make
sure
your
website
can
handle
the
traffic
this
publicity
push
might
generate!
If
you're
using
WordPress,
be
sure
to
install
and
properly
configure
a
plugin
such
as
W3
Total
Cache
(W3TC)
to
cache
your
pages
and
help
your
web
server
perform
better.
If
your
news
release
does
direct
readers
to
a
specific
web
page,
this
is
an
opportunity
to
put
landing
page
optimization
(LPO)
into
use�
so
be
sure
to
read
that
section
below
as
well.
You
want
to
convert
as
many
people
who
follow
the
link
to
your
site
into
paying
customers
as
possible,
and
there
are
techniques
for
doing
so.
Keeping
an
archive
of
your
press
releases
on
your
website
can�t
hurt,
either.
Additional
content
is
always
good
for
search
engine
optimization
purposes,
and
it
helps
reinforce
to
customers
that
you�re
a
real
company
with
a
real
PR
effort.
You
need
to
maintain
that
effort,
however.
If
the
most
recent
press
release
on
your
site
is
from
two
years
ago,
customers
will
instead
wonder
if
your
company
is
still
viable!
There's
more
to
PR
than
press
releases,
too.
Do
you
have
opportunities
to
speak
at
a
convention
or
a
trade
show?
Can
you
create
and
distribute
a
white
paper
relevant
to
your
industry?
Can
you
guest-blog
on
a
popular
website
your
customers
frequent?
There
are
many
creative
ways
to
get
your
name�
and
your
company's
name�
out
there.
BASICS
OF
ONLINE
ADVERTISING
Online
advertising
is
paid
efforts
to
drive
new
customers
to
your
website.
You
can
purchase
ads

from
Google
that
appear
whenever
someone
searches
for
what
your
company
does;
you
can
purchase
banner
or
display
ads
that
appear
on
websites
relevant
to
what
your
customer
does;
and
you
can
purchase
ads
on
social
networks
that
are
shown
to
people
that
fit
your
customer
profiles.
Especially
when
your
business
is
new,
this
can
be
a
very
important
way
to
connect
new
customers
with
your
business.

But,
it's
easy
to
throw
money
away
by
inadvertently
showing
ads
to
the
wrong
people.
Here
are
some
suggestions
for
optimizing
the
value
you
get
from
the
more
popular
online
advertising
channels.
Google
AdWords
Google
offers
an
impressive
toolset
for
targeted
online
advertising.
You
can
decide
how
much
or
how
little
you're
willing
to
spend
on
advertising,
and
Google
will
automatically
start
working
to
ensure
the
best
people
start
seeing
your
ads
both
in
search
results
and
across
the
web.
Go
set
up
an
account,
and
start
familiarizing
yourself
with
it.
First,
some
terminology:
"search
ads"
are
the
ads
you
see
when
searching
for
something
on
Google.
Usually,
the
first
few
search
results
are
actually
paid
placements,
and

you'll
also
see
text
ads
on
the
right
hand
side
of
your
search
results.
All
of
these
ads
came
from
people
who
bid
on
the
terms
you
searched
for,
who
believe
your
search
might
mean
you're
interested
in
what
they
offer.
You
can
play
this
game
as
well.
"Display
ads"
are
the
ad
images
you
see
all
over
the
web.
Banner
ads,
"skyscraper
ads"
on
the
side,
square-shaped
ads�
they
all
come
in
different
sizes.
Google
offers
an
ad
network
called
AdSense,
and
you
can
buy
ad
placements
on
websites
that
participate
in
it.
You
can
target
your
display
ads
to
specific
websites,
or
let
Google
try
to
automatically
find
relevant
websites
for
you.
Here
are
various
lessons
I've
learned
the
hard
way
about
getting
the
most
value
out
of
your
AdWords
spending:
Understand
and
measure
what
you
want
people
to
do.
AdWords
will
provide
you
with
stunning
amount
of
graphs
and
statistics
surrounding
the
performance
of
your
advertising
campaigns�
but
there
is
only
one
number
that
really
matters:
your
cost
per
action
(CPA).

This
is
how
much,
on
average,
you
paid
to
create
a
new
customer
through
your
ads.
In
order
to
measure
CPA,
you
will
need
to
find
some
action
that
users
take
on
your
website
that
indicates
they
have
become
a
customer,
and
feed
those
actions
back
to
Google.
Usually
this
means
they
purchased
something
from
you
online.
If
you
are
using
a
third-party
storefront
to
sell
your
products,
ask
them
how
they
are
integrated
with
Google
AdWords
or
with
Google
Analytics
and
how
to
tie
into
your
AdWords
account.
If
customers
perform
this
action
on
your
own
website,
AdWords
will
tell
you
how
to
insert
some
extra
code
in
your
website
that
notifies
Google
when
this
action
occurs.
CPA
is
usually
referred
to
as
"cost
per
converted
click"
within
AdWords,
and
you
may
need
to
add
a
column
for
this
metric
to
your
views
within
AdWords
to
see
it
and
track
it.
You
can
set
up
AdWords
campaigns
that
automatically
optimize
for
the
best
CPA,
but
for
this
to
work
well,
you
need
a
good
amount
of
"action"
data.
If
your
business
relies
on
a
small
number
of
high-dollar
sales,
sales
might
not
be
the
best
action
to
measure.
In
this
case,
you
may
need
to
use
some
proxy
for
sales,
such
as
downloading
an
evaluation
of
your
product,
in
order
to
generate
sufficient
data
for
Google
to
work
with.
If
the
action
you
want
of
your
visitors
doesn't
take
place
online
at
all,
you
have
a
bit
of
a
problem.
Perhaps
you
are
running
a
retail
storefront,
and
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
get
people
to
visit
your
physical
store.
First
of
all,
consider
if
there's
an
opportunity
to
also
sell
your
goods
online,
where
you
can
measure
the
effectiveness
of
your
advertising.
If
not,
you
can
at
least
restrict
your
online
advertising
geographically
to
people
who
are
near
your
physical
storefront.
A
geographically
restricted,
targeted
ad
campaign
will
be
inexpensive,
so
even
if
you
can't
measure
its
results
directly,
it's
probably
still
worth
doing.
You
need
to
decide
how
much
you're
willing
to
spend
on
whatever
action
you
choose
to
measure.
You
don't
want
to
spend
$10
in
exchange
for
a
customer
who
only
gives
you
$5
in
profit.
Even
breaking
even
isn't
enough�
some
of
the
customers
that
came
to
your
website
through
ad
campaigns
may
have
found
you
anyhow
through
other
means.

If
your
CPA
isn't
significantly
less
than
the
value
of
the
action
you
are
measuring,
then
your
ad
campaign
is
not
effective
and
needs
further
tuning.
Tread
carefully
with
mobile
ads.
By
default,
your
ads
will
appear
on
desktop
PC's,
tablets,
and
mobile
devices.
If
your
desired
action
requires
that
the
user
is
on
a
PC,
then
you're
largely
throwing
your
money
away
on
tablet
and
mobile
ads.
Google
does
give
you
the
ability
to
modify
the
devices
your
ads
are
shown
on,
so
use
that
wisely.
Also
realize
that
the
smaller
the
screen,
the
more
likely
someone
is
to
tap
your
ad
by
mistake.
Google
will
charge
you
by
the
click,
even
if
you're
optimizing
for
actions�
so
if
people
are
tapping
your
ad
that
had
no
interest
in
your
product,
you
are
going
to
be
driving
up
your
CPA
for
no
reason.
What's
even
worse
are
ads
embedded
inside
mobile
apps.
App
developers
often
make
all
of
their
money
through
these
ads,
and
sometimes
design
their
apps
to
trick
users
into
clicking
on
them.
Google
does
not
make
it
easy
to
disable
these
sorts
of
ads,
but
it
can
be
done.
You'll
have
to
search
for
the
current
technique,
as
it
is
likely
to
change
over
time.
At
the
time
of
this
writing,
you
can
exclude
mobile
app
ads
by
setting
up
a
"campaign
placement
exclusion"
for
adsenseformobileapps.com.
Separate
your
search
and
display
campaigns.
It's
a
good
practice
to
set
up
separate
ad
campaigns
in
AdWords
for
your
ads
that
appear
alongside
search
results,
and
for
your
banner
ads
that
appear
on
websites
that
participate
in
Google's
advertiser
network.
That
way,
Google
can
optimize
these
very
different
campaigns
separately.
Don't
display
your
ads
in
countries
that
won't
buy
your
product.
Your
campaign
settings
allow
you
to
list
specific
countries
your
ad
will
appear
in,
as
well
as
specific
countries
you
don't
want
your
campaign
to
appear
in.
To
minimize
the
risk
of
click
fraud�
companies
that
just
click
on
ads
on
websites
automatically
in
order
to
generate
revenue
for
those
sites�
don't
display
your
ads
in
countries
that
are
unlikely
to
want
your
product.
I
don't
want
to
name
names,
but
some
countries
are
more
notorious
than
others
when
it
comes
to
click
fraud.
At
a
minimum,
you'll
want
to
ban
countries
that
are
embargoed
that
you
can't
do
business
with
in
the
first
place.
You
can
get
a
list
of
embargoed
countries
from
the
US
Department
of
State's
website.
Countries
where
the
English
language
isn't
commonly
known
may
also
be
worth
avoiding,
if
your
website
is
in
English.
You
may
be
surprised
how
many
foreigners
do
know
English
as
a
second
language
however;
some
of
the
top
countries
that
visit
my
website
include
Russia,
China,
and
Germany,
and
they
spend
real
money
once
they
get
there.
Tread
carefully
with
the
display
ad
network.
If
you
are
targeting
a
narrow
niche
of
customers,
it
will
be
difficult
for
Google
to
automatically
find
the
best
websites
to
show
your
ads
on.
Instead
of
letting
Google
pick
what
sites
to
display
your
banner
ads
on,
choose
your
own
list
and
specify
them
as
placements
in
your
ad
groups.
Using
the
display
ad
network
also
increases
your
chance
of
being
a
victim
of
click
fraud�
I've
found
it
often
drives
up
traffic
to
my
website
significantly,
but
it
doesn't
increase
business
because
most
of
the
clicks
were
fraudulent
or
done
by
mistake.
Search
ads,
and
display
ads
that
target
specific
people
instead
of
certain
kinds
of
websites,
are
more
effective.
Use
negative
keywords.
In
your
search
campaigns,
periodically
check
what
people
are
actually
searching
for
before
they
click
on
your
ads.
You
can
see
this
under
the
"dimensions"
tab
of
your
campaign
in
AdWords,
and
then
selecting
"search
terms"
for
the
view.
Sort
this
list
by
cost
to
see
what
search
terms
you're
paying
the
most
for.
You
will
probably
find
that
you're
spending
a
lot
of
money
on
people
searching
for
things
completely
unrelated
to
your
business.
Perhaps
they
clicked
on
your
ads
out
of
curiosity,
or
by
mistake�
but
either
way
it
cost
you
money.
At
the
bottom
of
the
keyword
list
is
a
space
for
"negative
keywords"�
collect
these
searches
that
you
don't
want
to
pay
for
there,
and
it
will
prevent
you
from
paying
for
them
in
the
future.
You
should
check
this
at
least
weekly
at
first,
because
as
soon
as
you
ban
one
negative
keyword,
a
new
one
will
probably
pop
up
to
take
its
place.
New
trends
can
even
emerge
that
affect
you�
for
example,
one
of
my
own
products
is
called
"SilverLining".
When
the
movie
"Silver
Lining
Playbook"
came
out,
I
ended
up
paying
hundreds
of
dollars
from
people
searching
for
it.
Avoid
"broad
match"
keywords.
By
default,
the
search
keywords
you
target
in
your
search
campaign
are
"broad
match."
This
means
that
any
search
term
that
Google's
algorithms
believe
are
even
remotely
related
will
be
shown
your
ad.
Sometimes
it
gets
it
right,
but
as
reviewing
your
search
terms
will
reveal,
it
often
gets
it
very
wrong.
It
is
better
to
provide
a
longer
list
of
very
specific
phrases
that
are
relevant
to
your
business,
with
exact
or
phrase
matching
on
instead.
Often,
you'll
find
this
saves
money
in
more
ways
than
one�
not
only
are
you
only
showing
your
ads
alongside
relevant
searches,
these
more
specific
keywords
probably
cost
less
to
bid
on,
as
there
is
less
competition
for
them.
Use
ad
extensions
on
your
search
campaigns.
Ad
extensions
are
additional
links
that
show
up
underneath
your
search
ads.
They
can
include
links
to
specific
pages
of
your
website,
"call-outs"
that
are
short
snippets
of
text
that
toot
your
own
horn,
and
links
that
make
it
easy
for
customers
to
reach
your
physical
location
or
to
call
you.
They
don't
cost
anything
extra,
and
they
can
result
in
more
screen
space
being
dedicated
to
your
search
ads.
You
can
set
these
up
under
the
"ad
extensions"
tab
of
your
campaign
view.
Try
out
remarketing
campaigns.
AdWords
can
give
you
some
code
to
include
in
your
website
that
will
track
customers
that
have
visited
it.
You
can
then
show
display
ads
to
them
as
they
browse
the
web
on
other
sites.
A
lot
of
people
will
visit
your
website,
but
not
act
upon
it
immediately.
Remarketing
campaigns
allow
you
to
remind
them
that
you're
around,
and
you
have
something
they
were
interested
in.
This
can
be
surprisingly
effective;
it's
basically
an
automatic
way
to
close
sales
without
involving
salespeople.
Some
of
my
best
CPA's
are
from
remarketing
campaigns.
Use
"similar
visitors".
Once
you
have
a
remarketing
campaign
set
up,
you
can
also
start
showing
ads
to
people
who
have
similar
behavior
to
the
people
who
visited
your
website.
To
do
this,
you
set
up
a
campaign
targeted
to
an
"audience"
that
is
composed
to
similar
visitors
to
your
website.
I've
found
these
campaigns
yield
CPA's
that
are
even
lower
than
remarketing
at
times.
Talk
to
your
account
strategist.
Once
you've
gotten
things
up
and
running
and
have
started
collecting
some
data,
you'll
probably
get
a
call
or
an
email
from
a
Google
"account
strategist"
who
wants
to
set
up
some
time
to
review
your
account.
This
time
can
be
amazingly
well
spent.
I've
found
these
representatives
to
be
very
knowledgeable
about
optimizing
the
results
you
get
from
your
AdWords
campaigns,
and
they
often
have
ideas
I
never
considered.
They
also
take
the
time
to
try
and
understand
your
business
and
what
you're
trying
to
accomplish
before
they
even
talk
to
you.
Nobody
knows
more
about
optimizing
AdWords
campaign
than
Google
itself,
so
definitely
accept
their
help
when
they
offer
it
to
you.
Use
landing
page
optimization
techniques.
We'll
talk
about
this
more
later,
but
the
page
you
link
an
ad
to
(the
"landing
page")
should
be
closely
tied
to
the
ad
itself,
and
what
the
user
searched
for
in
order
to
see
your
ad.
Some
sites
create
individual
pages
for
every
ad
they
run,
in
order
to
ensure
the
page
the
user
ends
up
at
is
as
relevant
as
possible
to
their
current
interest
and
the
ad
they
clicked
on.
For
this
to
work
best,
you'll
want
to
split
up
your
AdWords
campaigns
into
separate
ad
groups
targeted
at
specific
customer
personas,
and
tailor
the
keywords,
ads,
and
landing
pages
to
be
unique
for
each
ad
group.
AdWords
is
also
more
likely
to
display
ads
that
link
to
pages
that
are
highly
relevant
to
the
ad
itself,
and
so
this
effort
pays
off
in
more
ways
than
one.
Buying
Banner
Ads
If
there
are
websites
that
are
strongly
related
to
what
your
business
offers,
you
might
consider
purchasing
ads
on
those
sites
directly.
These
direct
ad
buys
are
often
much
more
expensive
than
what
you
would
pay
through
Google
AdWords
or
other
ad
networks.
Sometimes,
these
web
sites
will
sell
ads
directly,
and
sell
any
unused
page
views
("impressions")
through
Google's
AdSense
network.
These
left-over
ad
impressions
are
known
as
"remnant
ads,"
and
they
can
offer
an
opportunity
to
test
the
waters
on
a
website
without
spending
a
lot
of
money.
Check
if
your
website
is
one
you
can
target
as
a
placement
in
your
AdWords
account,
and
if
so,
you
can
probably
get
some
ads
on
it
at
a
very
low
cost.
Those
remnant
ads
tend
to
be
for
lower-value
placements
on
the
site
however,
so
you
can't
necessarily
use
their
performance
as
a
gauge
for
how
well
a
better-placed
banner
ad
at
the
top
of
their
site
would
do.
How
can
you
decide
if
a
paid
ad
placement
on
a
specific
website
is
worthwhile?
Well,
a
decent
assumption
is
that
perhaps
1%
of
people
who
see
your
ad
on
a
relevant
website
will
click
on
it.
You
can
use
metrics
from
your
website
to
estimate
what
percentage
of
visitors
to
your
website
end
up
buying
something,
and
use
that
information
to
estimate
the
amount
of
sales
this
ad
might
generate.
If
it�s
substantially
more
than
the
expense
of
a
given
number
of
ad
impressions,
then
this
could
be
money
well
spent.
Oftentimes,
the
math
won't
support
the
ad
buy.
The
person
selling
you
this
ad
will
probably
talk
a
lot
about
"brand
awareness"
and
other
intangible
benefits
of
the
ad,
but
you
will
never
have
any
way
of
measuring
whether
it's
effective.
Just
let
them
know
what
price
does
make
sense
for
you�
if
they
aren't
selling
through
their
available
ad
impressions,
they
may
give
you
a
bargain
or
some
sort
of
attractive
bundle
deal.
If
you
do
purchase
a
banner
ad
directly
from
a
website
owner,
be
sure
that
the
URL
you
link
the
ad
to
contains
any
tracking
codes
required
for
you
to
measure
how
many
visitors
this
ad
generated,
and
how
they
behaved
once
they
got
to
your
website.
We'll
talk
more
about
Google
Analytics
and
measuring
website
performance
later,
but
if
you
do
use
Google
Analytics,
it
offers
a
"URL
Builder"
tool
that
can
construct
the
required
URL's
for
you.
You'll
want
to
review
the
performance
of
this
ad
at
least
once
a
month,
as
you'll
probably
find
that
its
performance
deteriorates
over
time
as
people
become
accustomed
to
your
ad.
When
that
happens,
you
may
want
to
try
replacing
the
banner
ad
with
a
fresh
one
in
order
to
catch
more
attention.
Since
you're
paying
a
lot
for
this
ad,
try
to
make
it
as
relevant
as
possible
to
the
readers
of
the
site
you're
advertising
on.
Make
it
look
like
it's
content
that
could
even
be
part
of
the
site,
and
not
just
an
ad
that
people
tune
out.
Some
websites
will
offer
"advertorial"
features
or
�native
ads�
that
integrate
into
the
design
of
the
site
itself,
and
these
are
often
more
effective
than
traditional
banner
ads
�
but
also
more
expensive.
Also,
be
sure
to
use
a
trained
graphic
designer
to
create
your
banner
ads.
There
is
a
whole
science
to
creating
ads
with
just
the
right
colors,
contrast,
and
style
to
maximize
their
performance.
It's
money
well
spent.
Arm
your
designer
with
some
images
and
a
very
short
amount
of
text
you
want
included
in
the
ad,
and
let
them
come
up
with
ideas.
You
can
also
re-use
these
ads
in
your
AdWords
account,
and
run
different
variants
of
them
at
the
same
time
to
measure
which
ones
are
the
most
effective.
Facebook
Ads
If
your
business
caters
to
a
specific
demographic
that
you
can
identify
through
gender,
location,
occupation,
or
interests�
Facebook
ads
may
be
worth
trying
out.
Facebook
users
entrust
Facebook
with
a
ridiculous
amount
of
their
personal
information,
and
you
can
use
this
to
your
advantage.
Facebook
allows
you
to
target
ads
to
extremely
narrow
demographic
slices.
If
these
slices
correlate
to
your
customers,
and
your
customers
are
likely
to
use
Facebook,
then
it's
worth
trying
out.
Like
AdWords,
you
can
spend
as
little
or
as
much
as
you
want�
so
you
can
test
the
waters
with
Facebook
ads
without
incurring
a
large
expense.
I
have
personally
found
it
challenging
to
achieve
a
cost
per
action
with
Facebook
ads
that
outperforms
a
well-optimized
AdWords
campaign,
but
results
will
vary
widely
depending
on
the
nature
of
your
business.
It's
worth
spending
$100
as
a
test
and
just
see
what
sort
of
return
you
get
on
that.
Facebook
also
offers
a
robust
system
for
measuring
the
performance
of
your
ads,
and
so
you
can
just
decide
whether
to
use
them
based
on
the
data.
Be
sure
you
are
looking
at
actual
traffic
generated
to
your
website
by
these
ads,
however.
Remember
someone
"liking"
you
on
Facebook
is
pretty
much
worthless.
Facebook
will
try
and
group
clicks,
likes,
and
shares
together
when
presenting
the
value
of
your
ad.
Likes
and
shares
don't
pay
the
bills�
people
who
click
on
your
website
and
buy
something
do.
As
with
display
ads
on
Google
AdWords,
you
need
to
be
aware
of
click
fraud
with
Facebook
ads
as
well.
There
are
"click
farms"
in
places
like
the
Philippines
that
have
armies
of
people
creating
fake
Facebook
accounts
that
generate
fake
likes
and
shares
for
people.
These
can
affect
you,
because
to
escape
detection,
they
"like"
other
things
they
are
presented
(such
as
your
ad)
so
it's
not
so
obvious
what
they
are
doing.
The
more
sophisticated
click
farms
even
make
it
look
like
their
clicks
are
originating
from
US
cities,
making
them
difficult
to
filter
out.
As
a
basic
line
of
defense,
at
least
set
up
some
geographical
targeting
in
your
account
to
only
show
your
ads
to
people
in
parts
of
the
world
that
are
likely
to
respond
to
them.
There
are
stories
of
small
businesses
spending
lots
of
money
on
Facebook
ads,
only
to
find
out
later
that
most
of
their
response
came
from
a
click
farm
in
Iraq.
No
joke.
Facebook,
like
Google,
is
doing
their
best
to
eliminate
fraud
from
their
advertising
programs,
but
it
is
a
never-ending
arms
race
with
the
fraudsters.
With
any
advertising,
it's
important
to
evaluate
whether
you
saw
an
increase
in
sales
associated
with
the
campaign.
No
matter
what
metrics
you
may
have
about
the
reach
of
your
ad,
all
that
really
matters
is
whether
it
generated
more
sales
revenue
than
the
cost
of
the
campaign
in
the
long
run.
Every
market
is
different,
so
I
recommend
setting
up
relatively
inexpensive
tests
with
various
advertising
channels
to
see
what
works
best.
Whenever
possible,
ask
your
customers
how
they
heard
about
you.
If
they
never
mention
your
ads,
then
question
your
level
of
investment�
it
probably
means
you're
spending
too
much
on
them.
Other
Online
Ad
Channels
There
are
countless
ways
to
spend
your
money
on
online
advertising.
Twitter,
Instagram,
LinkedIn,
Bing,
Yahoo,
Amazon,
and
many
others
would
love
to
take
your
money.
I
don't
personally
have
direct
experience
with
these
other
channels
as
an
advertiser.
You
should
think
about
where
your
customers
hang
out
online,
as
it
could
be
one
of
those
places.
Ads
on
Amazon
may
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
are
selling
a
consumer-oriented
product.
Your
customers
may
be
highly
active
on
Twitter
or
LinkedIn,
and
advertising
there
may
be
a
good
way
to
reach
them
without
investing
huge
amounts
of
time
managing
your
social
media
presence.
My
general
advice
is
to
work
backwards
from
where
your
customers
are,
and
advertise
there.
Target
your
ads
to
your
potential
customers
as
well
as
you
can.
And
test
the
waters
with
any
new
advertiser
with
a
low-cost
campaign
before
investing
significant
money
with
them.
You
can
learn
a
lot
by
gambling
just
$100,
or
the
lowest-cost
ad
campaign
a
channel
offers,
and
comparing
the
resulting
CPA�s
after
a
week
or
two.
BASICS
OF
OFFLINE
MARKETING
Not
all
advertising
is
online.
As
an
example,
let�s
say
your
business
sells
some
specialty
item
for
amateur
astronomers.
In
that
case,
taking
out
an
ad
in
Sky
&
Telescope
magazine
might
make
perfect
sense.
If
there
is
some
publication
that
is
highly
relevant
to
what
your
business
offers,
it
deserves
your
consideration.
You
can
still
do
some
back-of-the-envelope
calculations
to
figure
out
if
it�s
worthwhile.
You
can
find
out
the
number
of
copies
of
the
magazine
that
are
printed,
and
how
many
aren't
returned
unsold.
That
tells
you
how
many
people
your
ad
will
reach.
Assume
less
than
1%
will
act
on
your
ad,
and
some
small
percentage
of
those
who
do
actually
buy
something
in
the
end.
If
the
sales
number
you
end
up
with
exceeds
the
cost
of
the
ad,
it
may
be
worth
trying.
A
small
ad
in
the
back
of
a
niche
publication
can
often
be
had
for
just
a
few
hundred
dollars,
so
it's
not
an
expensive
experiment
to
try.
How
do
you
know
if
a
sale
resulted
from
that
ad,
however?
There
are
only
two
ways
I
know
of.
One
is
to
simply
ask
your
customers
how
they
found
you
after
you've
taken
their
money�
many
will
be
happy
to
share
that
information.
The
other
is
to
use
some
custom
URL
or
phone
number
that
is
specific
to
this
ad.
Then,
the
number
of
visits
to
that
URL
or
number
of
calls
will
tell
you
how
many
people
acted
on
that
ad,
and
who
ended
up
buying
something
later
on.
As
with
everything,
measure
the
results
before
investing
more
money
into
any
advertising
channel.
In
addition
to
magazines�
newspapers,
local
television,
niche
cable
TV
channels,
and
radio
are
other
advertising
venues
worth
thinking
about.
If
you've
followed
my
advice
about
building
a
business
that
has
a
global
reach,
local
TV,
radio,
and
news
advertising
probably
isn't
worthwhile�
but
for
many
businesses,
it
is.
As
with
online
advertising,
the
key
is
to
find
a
way
to
target
your
message
to
the
people
most
likely
to
respond
to
it.
If
there's
a
local
TV
show
and
you
know
most
of
its
viewers
are
potential
customers
of
yours,
it's
worth
thinking
about.
Advertising
on
it
won't
be
cheap,
but
it
might
be
something
you
decide
to
save
up
for.
There
are
other
ways
to
advertise
in
the
physical
world,
as
well.
Think
creatively
about
places
where
your
potential
customers
tend
to
congregate
exclusively.
Is
there
an
industry
trade
show,
conference,
or
convention
they
go
to?
Consider
advertising
in
its
program,
or
being
a
sponsor
of
it.

Are
a
lot
of
them
in
a
specific
office
park?
Consider
a
nearby
billboard,
or
an
ad
on
a
bus
stop
bench.
Is
there
a
popular
Meetup
group
for
them?
Consider
hosting
that
group
at
your
own
venue,
joining
it,
or
sponsoring
it.
Selling
your
stuff
at
a
Meetup
gathering
is
poor
form,
but
it's
totally
OK
to
tell
people
what
you
do
while
introducing
yourself.
People
who
might
be
interested
will
talk
to
you
afterward.
Trade
show
booths
are
another
form
of
advertising,
but
in
my
experience
their
value
proposition
can
be
dodgy
for
small
businesses
like
yours.
You're
looking
at
over
$10,000
plus
travel
expenses
for
even
the
smallest
booth
in
most
cases,
so
you
need
to
be
pretty
confident
that
your
presence
there
will
generate
more
than
$10,000
in
new
profits.
For
a
small
business,
that's
a
pretty
tall
order.
And
you
can't
just
put
up
a
booth
in
the
corner
and
expect
people
to
come
dump
money
on
your
lap�
you
need
to
do
a
lot
of
work
before
the
trade
show
to
publicize
your
booth
to
attendees,
and
arrange
meetings
with
potential
customers
at
the
show
ahead
of
time.
You'll
need
to
invest
a
lot
of
time
in
following
up
with
people
afterwards,
as
well.
Often
it's
more
cost-effective
to
just
attend
the
show
as
an
individual,
and
carry
around
a
bunch
of
business
cards
for
the
connections
you
make
while
you're
there.
I
like
to
walk
around
with
a
tablet
running
a
demo
of
my
software,
so
I
can
show
interested
parties
my
technology
without
a
booth
at
all
(be
careful
not
to
run
afoul
of
any
policies
of
the
trade
show
when
doing
something
like
that�
your
smartphone
may
have
to
do
if
attendees
aren't
permitted
to
bring
larger
items
onto
the
show
floor).
You
may
get
more
value
focusing
your
time
on
networking
at
the
show,
instead
of
manning
a
booth.
Still,
consider
it
carefully.
In
some
industries
(arcade
games
come
to
mind),
a
booth
at
a
specific
trade
show
is
basically
the
only
way
in,
so
I
can't
provide
one-size-fits-all
advice
on
the
topic.
How
about
physical
mailings?
In
the
early
stages
of
my
company,
I
mined
my
LinkedIn
network
and
LinkedIn
groups
to
find
people
who
might
need
my
product,
and
were
in
a
position
to
approve
its
purchase.
I
went
to
their
company
websites
to
get
a
mailing
address,
and
sent
each
of
them
a
physical
brochure
accompanied
by
a
personalized,
signed
letter.
About
10%
of
the
people
I
contacted
ended
up
purchasing
my
product�
which
is
an
excellent
return
on
some
paper,
a
stamp,
and
a
few
minutes
of
my
time!
I
ended
up
contracting
a
college
student
to
help
scale
that
effort
up.
Most
tech
companies
have
abandoned
direct
mail
in
favor
of
email
campaigns�
but
you
can
do
both,
and
use
the
relatively
empty
physical
mailbox
of
your
customers
as
a
chance
to
better
grab
their
attention.
BASICS
OF
SEARCH
ENGINE
OPTIMIZATION
Are
people
likely
to
be
looking
for
business
like
yours
while
searching
on
Google
or
other
search
engines?
If
so,
optimizing
your
website
to
get
the
best
rankings
on
Google
can
yield
large
rewards,
and
the
only
cost
is
your
time�
if
you
know
what
you're
doing.
If
you
are
using
a
content
management
system
such
as
Wordpress
to
host
your
website,
the
first
thing
is
to
install
a
plugin
for
search
engine
optimization
(SEO).
I
use
Wordpress
along
with
a
plugin
called
"WordPress
SEO"
by
a
company
called
Yoast,
with
good
results.
I
still
invest
in
paid
advertising
for
my
website
through
Google
AdWords,
but
only
about
15%
of
my
visitors
originate
from
ads.
The
other
85%
found
me
for
free.
Paying
attention
to
SEO
means
relying
less
and
less
on
paid
advertising
over
time,
which
ultimately
puts
more
profit
into
your
hands.
Here
are
a
few
basic
best
practices
to
maximize
what
is
known
as
"organic
search
traffic"�
that
is,
visitors
to
your
website
that
found
you
through
a
search
you
didn't
pay
for.
Update
your
website
on
a
regular
basis.
Even
if
you
doubt
anyone
will
ever
read
it,
I
recommend
having
some
sort
of
blog
on
your
website
that
you
update
around
once
a
week,
at
a
minimum.
The
benefits
are
twofold:
search
engines
tend
to
prefer
sites
that
are
fresh
and
current,
and
the
extra
content
you
create
in
your
blog
posts
will
create
new
pages
that
may
rank
highly
for
search
terms
you
never
even
knew
were
important.
The
content
you
create
for
your
blog
can
also
be
re-used
for
social
media
and
email
newsletters,
discussed
below.
While
it's
OK
to
blog
about
your
product's
features,
you
also
want
to
touch
on
more
general
issues
faced
by
your
customer
base
to
encourage
sharing
of
your
content,
and
to
rank
for
new
search
keywords.
Get
linked
to.
A
website
that
nobody
links
to
won't
look
very
authoritative
in
the
eyes
of
search
engines.
Are
there
other
popular
websites
that
cover
your
industry
that
might
publish
an
article
of
yours,
with
a
link
to
your
site?
Are
there
reputable
online
directories
for
your
industry?
Can
you
guest-blog
on
a
popular
site
and
sneak
in
a
link
or
two
back
to
your
site?
Think
creatively.
News
releases
can
also
result
in
links
from
news
sites.
Here's
an
easy
one:
become
active
on
forums
related
to
your
industry,
with
a
link
to
your
site
in
the
signature.
Make
sure
the
sites
you're
getting
links
from
are
relevant
to
what
your
site
is
about.
This
sort
of
work
is
referred
to
as
"link
building."
Generally
speaking,
you
don't
want
to
pay
for
links�
Google
is
smart
enough
to
recognize
"link
farms"
and
may
penalize
you
for
using
them.
Figure
out
the
best
keywords
to
target.
A
lot
of
people
get
hung
up
on
the
concept
of
"their
ranking
on
Google."
That
is
a
meaningless
concept!
You
have
thousands
of
different
rankings
on
Google,
depending
on
what
people
typed
into
the
search
bar
while
they
were
trying
to
discover
what
your
company
has
to
offer.
It's
not
too
hard
to
become
the
#1
search
result
when
someone
types
in
your
company
name�
but
it's
the
people
who
don't
already
know
about
your
company
that
are
more
valuable.
If
you
have
a
Google
AdWords
account,
you
can
use
data
from
it
to
determine
which
keywords
seem
most
relevant
to
your
site
by
sorting
them
by
CTR
(click
through
rate.)
You
can
also
use
AdWords'
keyword
tool
to
get
an
idea
of
what
keywords
are
searched
for
most
often.
Ideally,
you
want
to
find
search
terms
that
are
very
specific
to
what
your
company
offers�
there
will
be
less
competition
for
these
search
terms,
and
so
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
rank
highly
for
them.
The
keywords
you
decide
to
target
are
the
ones
you'll
want
to
focus
on
when
writing
the
text
on
your
website.
Make
sure
your
web
pages
have
text
in
them.
Although
the
current
web
design
trends
are
very
image-focused,
search
engines
will
have
a
much
easier
time
determining
what
your
website
is
about
if
you
have
text
relevant
to
the
customers
you
are
trying
to
reach.
At
least
have
a
couple
of
paragraphs
describing
what
your
website
is
about,
making
sure
to
include
the
keywords
you
want
to
rank
for
in
that
description.
Make
sure
your
images
include
<alt>
tags
that
provide
a
textual
description
of
what
they
are.
Pay
attention
to
titles
and
headers.
Search
engines
pay
special
attention
to
your
page
titles
and
your
page
headers.
At
a
HTML
level,
this
is
information
contained
within
<title>,
<h1>,
<h2>,
etc.
Because
this
text
is
highlighted
on
your
webpage,
they
know
it's
pretty
important
in
describing
what
your
page
is
about.
Be
sure
to
use
the
keywords
you
are
targeting
within
these
tags
in
order
to
rank
most
highly
for
them.
Your
page
titles
should
contain
your
company
name,
along
with
a
description
of
the
page
that
includes
the
keywords
that
best
describe
it�
but
Google
will
only
display
the
first
55
or
so
characters
of
it,
so
keep
it
short.
Your
title
is
basically
the
headline
that
Google
will
show
in
search
results,
so
it's
especially
important
to
pay
attention
to
it.
Get
a
Google
Webmaster
Tools
account.
By
setting
up
an
account
that's
tied
to
your
website,
you'll
be
able
to
see
if
Google
is
having
any
trouble
when
it
crawls
your
site
to
determine
its
content.
There
are
many
technical
problems
that
could
result
in
your
website
being
essentially
invisible
to
Google,
and
you
need
to
address
them
if
they
exist.
There
are
also
extra
tools
within
Webmaster
Tools
to
help
you
identify
the
best
keywords
to
target
for
SEO.
Pay
attention
to
your
user
experience.
Search
engines
don't
just
focus
on
whether
your
website's
content
is
relevant
to
what
someone
is
searching
for;
they
also
determine
how
good
of
an
experience
someone
will
have
once
they
get
there.
If
people
will
be
searching
for
you
from
mobile
devices
and
tablets,
then
you
need
to
have
a
website
that
is
"adaptive"
and
lays
itself
out
better
for
these
smaller
screens.
Load
up
your
site
on
your
smartphone�
if
you
can't
read
what
it
says,
then
you
may
have
a
problem.
Site
speed
is
also
taken
into
account,
so
be
sure
to
install
and
properly
configure
any
caching
plugins
your
content
management
system
may
offer.
Many
people
create
entire
careers
out
of
SEO,
so
there's
much
more
to
it
if
you'd
like
to
learn

I
recommend

BASICS
OF
LANDING
PAGE
OPTIMIZATION
Let's
say
someone
discovers
your
web
page
about
your
product
through
a
paid
ad,
or
through
a
search
result,
and
they
click
on
the
link
to
your
page.
That's
great,
but
you're
not
done
yet�
you
need
to
convert
that
visitor
into
a
paying
customer!
Landing
page
optimization
(LPO)
is
maximizing
the
chance
that
someone
who
visits
your
web
page
will
actually
do
something
that's
valuable
for
you,
and
not
just
lose
interest
and
click
away,
never
to
be
seen
again.
One
way
to
do
this
is
through
the
design
of
your
page.
It
should
call
attention
to
the
action
that
you
want
your
visitors
to
take
once
they
are
there,
and
allow
them
to
determine
within
a
few
seconds
whether
that
action
might
be
worth
taking.
As
an
example,
here
is
one
of
my
own
landing
pages,
used
when
someone
is
searching
for
software
for
simulating
the
sky
and
clouds:

Notice
how
there's
not
a
whole
lot
of
text�
just
the
main
points
needed
to
convey
what
my
product
is,
and
the
problem
it
solves
for
my
customers.
There
is
a
big,
orange
button
inviting
the
customer
to
do
what
I
want
them
to
do�
download
a
free
evaluation
of
my
product.
Many
people
would
recommend
even
eliminating
the
menu
or
"site
navigation"
links
on
a
landing
page,
and
make
clicking
that
button
the
only
possible
action.
I
didn't
go
that
far,
as
my
products
are
fairly
expensive
and
customers
are
likely
to
want
more
depth
on
my
company
and
its
offerings.
If
you
scroll
down,
more
detailed
information
is
available
about
the
product�
but
above
the
fold,
things
have
been
kept
as
simple
and
visual
as
possible.
A
large
video
dominates
the
page,
which
auto-plays
when
loaded.
It's
designed
to
capture
your
attention
before
you
click
away.
Be
sure
your
landing
pages
are
customer-focused;
the
value
proposition
of
your
product
to
your
customers
must
be
clearly
and
concisely
communicated.
In
my
case,
it's
the
time
they
save
by
purchasing
this
technology
off
the
shelf,
and
that's
what
I
lead
with.
Your
landing
page
is
also
an
opportunity
to
gather
sales
lead
information;
in
this
example,
I'm
requesting
email
addresses
to
automatically
add
to
my
newsletter
mailing
list.
Most
people
are
wary
of
getting
more
spam
however,
and
I'd
rather
have
them
download
my
product
evaluation
than
get
scared
away�
so
on
my
page,
that
email
address
is
optional.
Most
of
the
people
who
do
submit
one
use
a
fake
address,
but
a
few
do
provide
a
real
one.
My
email
platform
automatically
removes
undeliverable
email
addresses,
so
those
fake
addresses
don't
do
any
harm.
Relevance
is
also
important
to
LPO.
Think
about
the
different
kinds
of
customers
you
have,
and
create
an
experience
unique
to
each
kind.
Every
type
of
customer
you
have
should
have
their
own
ad
campaigns
that
speak
to
their
specific
interests,
which
lead
to
a
specialized
landing
page
that
also
focuses
on
that
unique
interest.
If
your
landing
page
is
highly
relevant
to
the
words
in
your
ad,
Google
AdWords
will
reward
you
with
more
and
better
impressions
of
that
ad�
so
the
benefits
are
twofold.
The
more
the
user
feels
like
your
landing
page
was
built
just
for
them,
the
more
they
are
likely
to
convert
into
a
paying
customer.
You
may
end
up
maintaining
a
large
number
of
slightly
different
landing
pages
and
ads
as
a
result,
but
it
is
time
well
spent.
Landing
page
optimization
is
also
a
large
discipline
in
its
own
right.

Moz.com
also
offers
many
great
blog
articles
on
the
topic
of
LPO
if
you'd
like
to
learn
more.
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
EMAIL
CAMPAIGNS
Email
is
still
one
of
the
most
effective
channels
for
reaching
your
customers,
when
done
properly.
Not
only
does
it
let
you
reach
new
customers,
it
keeps
you
in
mind
with
your
existing
customers�
making
it
more
likely
that
they'll
buy
your
products
again,
or
refer
you
to
their
friends.
First,
you
need
a
means
of
maintaining
your
mailing
list
and
sending
mass
emails�
in
a
way
that
won't
end
up
getting
all
of
your
emails
automatically
spam-filtered.
For
beginners,
I
recommend
using
a
third
party
service
such
as
MailChimp
or
Constant
Contact,
as
it
will
be
the
most
foolproof
approach.
I
created
my
own
mass
email
system
using
a
package
called
Dada
Mail
together
with
Amazon's
Simple
Email
Service
in
order
to
keep
the
expense
low�
but
if
you're
not
very
technically
inclined,
it's
all
too
easy
mess
up
in
such
a
way
that
results
in
emails
from
your
domain,
including
your
personal
emails,
not
getting
delivered.
You
can
always
start
with
a
paid
service,
and
move
to
your
own
later
once
you
know
what
you're
doing.
MailChimp
even
allows
you
to
start
off
for
free,
and
upgrade
to
a
paid
account
only
once
you
have
a
large
subscriber
base
or
need
access
to
more
advanced
features.
So
it�s
not
even
something
you
have
to
budget
for
initially.
Don't
be
a
spammer.
Only
send
emails
to
people
who
opt
in,
either
by
becoming
a
customer
of
yours,
or
providing
you
with
an
email
address.
Your
website
should
have
a
signup
form
on
it,
and
your
landing
pages
should
solicit
email
addresses
in
exchange
for
whatever
your
page
is
offering.
You
are
legally
required
to
provide
a
means
to
unsubscribe
from
your
mailing
list
with
each
message;
using
a
package
such
as
MailChimp
or
Constant
Contact
will
ensure
these
are
processed
correctly.
Once
you've
got
a
mass
email
system
and
some
subscribers,
you
need
to
decide
what
to
send
them.
Have
you
been
maintaining
a
blog
like
I
recommended
in
the
SEO
section?
If
so,
you
can
just
send
a
digest
of
your
blog
entries
once
a
month.
Major
new
product
announcements
are
of
course
also
relevant.
As
with
everything,
keep
these
emails
customer-focused;
they
should
address
the
problems
your
customers
are
faced
with,
and
that
might
not
even
have
anything
to
do
with
your
products.
The
main
point
is
to
remind
your
subscribers
that
you're
around,
and
that
your
company
is
an
authority
in
solving
whatever
problems
they
have.
Keep
the
tone
conversational,
so
your
customers
feel
like
they're
reading
a
personal
email
and
not
just
product
marketing.
Email
frequency
is
also
something
to
think
about.
Once
or
twice
a
month
is
enough
to
keep
your
company
in
the
back
of
everyone's
minds.

Emails
sent
too
frequently
will
start
to
be
viewed
as
spam,
and
increase
the
likelihood
of
people
unsubscribing.
Finally�
make
sure
to
send
a
test
mail
to
yourself
before
pushing
the
button
to
send
it
to
your
entire
mailing
list!
You
want
to
catch
missing
subject
lines,
broken
links,
and
typos
before
your
customers
do.
Once
that
mass
email
goes
out,
there's
no
way
to
take
it
back�
so
take
your
time
editing
and
proofreading
it
first.
USING
SOCIAL
NETWORKS
Marketing
through
social
networks
has
become
challenging,
as
they
are
starting
to
push
paid
advertising
in
favor
of
reach
that
could
be
had
for
free
in
years
past.
But
in
many
industries,
social
networks
are
still
an
important
component
of
your
inbound
marketing
efforts.
If
your
customers
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
social
networks,
then
figuring
out
how
to
reach
them
�
and
their
friends
�
is
worthwhile.
You
need
to
think
about
who
your
customers
are,
and
where
they
hang
out
online.
Are
you
selling
craft
products?
Pinterest
may
be
the
most
important
network
for
you
to
focus
on,
then.
Marketing
to
younger
people?
Try
Instagram.
Business-to-business?
LinkedIn
might
be
for
you
(that�s
the
one
I
target
the
most).
Twitter
is
still
important
as
well.
I'm
sure
that
list
will
probably
change
by
this
time
next
year,
so
again�
just
think
about
what
social
networks
are
used
most
by
your
potential
customers,
and
focus
on
them.
Effective
maintenance
of
a
social
network
presence
can
be
a
full
time
job
in
itself.
As
a
small
business
owner,
you
need
to
just
pick
one
or
two
of
them
to
focus
on.
Here
are
some
general
social
media
tips:
Twitter
is
a
lot
of
work.
Twitter
posts
in
themselves
are
very
likely
to
be
lost
in
the
noise
of
everything
else.
Using
Twitter
effectively
is
more
about
outreach
through
your
other
activities
on
Twitter.
You
should
be
retweeting
and
replying
to
people
within
your
industry
much
more
often
than
you
are
posting
about
your
own
company.
Twitter
is
about
building
up
your
subscriber
base,
and
staying
active
not
only
with
your
own
announcements
but
in
the
discussions
of
others.
Even
if
you
have
a
product
announcement
that
gets
re-tweeted
by
some
account
with
a
huge
amount
of
followers,
you'll
just
see
a
surge
of
traffic
that
disappears
within
a
few
minutes.
The
goal
here
is
to
become
a
well-known
name
within
the
community
of
your
potential
customers�
and
that's
better
served
by
re-tweeting
information
that
is
useful
to
them,
regardless
of
whether
it
comes
from
your
company
or
not.
You
need
to
be
posting
several
times
per
day
to
get
the
most
out
of
Twitter
from
a
marketing
standpoint,
so
think
carefully
about
whether
you
expect
the
return
from
that
effort
to
be
worth
the
time.
With
Facebook,
my
advice
is
almost
to
not
even
bother.
Even
if
you
can
get
a
large
number
of
people
to
"like"
your
company
page,
your
updates
will
only
be
shown
to
about
6%
of
those
followers�
and
that
number
is
likely
to
decrease
further
as
Facebook
tries
to
force
companies
into
paid
advertising
and
promotion
of
their
posts.
As
discussed
earlier,
Facebook
is
worth
evaluating
as
an
advertising
platform,
but
don't
expect
much
free
exposure
for
your
company
through
it.
There
may
be
some
SEO
benefit
to
having
a
FaceBook
page
that
links
to
your
main
website,
and
that
alone
may
be
worth
the
small
effort
of
setting
one
up.
LinkedIn
is
useful
for
B2B
businesses.
If
you're
a
business
that
sells
to
other
businesses,
LinkedIn
is
worth
looking
at.
Product
announcements
framed
as
a
personal
achievement
aren't
viewed
as
"spammy"
there,
and
getting
involved
in
LinkedIn
group
discussions
is
an
easy
way
to
get
your
name
in
the
inbox
of
hundreds
of
people.
Don't
just
post
about
your
company.
Become
a
valued
resource
for
the
people
who
follow
you.
Don't
just
market
your
stuff�
find
articles
and
information
that
are
relevant
to
your
customer
base.
Participate
in
other
discussions.
Nobody
wants
to
follow
a
commercial
on
social
media
(unless
it�s
incredibly
clever);
instead,
provide
useful
content
that's
all
about
your
customers,
not
all
about
you.
Maintaining
a
social
network
presence
for
your
company
can
be
very
time-consuming,
and
as
a
small
business
owner
you
probably
have
more
efficient
ways
to
spend
your
time.
As
addictive
as
social
media
can
be,
you
must
measure
the
impact
it
is
having
on
your
business,
and
budget
your
time
accordingly.
If
your
social
media
efforts
aren't
resulting
in
a
substantial
percentage
of
your
website
traffic
originating
from
social
media
sites,
or
your
customers
aren't
saying
they
discovered
you
through
social
media,
then
you
should
question
if
this
is
what
you
should
be
spending
your
time
on.
That's
a
great
segue
into
our
next
section...
MEASURE
AND
ACT
It's
important
that
you
measure
the
effectiveness
of
your
various
marketing
campaigns,
and
act
upon
those
results.
If
you
sell
products
online,
Google
Analytics
is
a
free,
sophisticated
tool
that
lets
you
track
trends
with
your
customers,
and
where
those
customers
came
from.
Go
get
an
account,
and
integrate
it
with
your
website
and
any
other
websites
that
sell
your
products
on
your
behalf.
I
could
write
an
entire
book
about
using
Google
Analytics,
and
I'm
sure
others
have.
But
even
with
the
most
basic
integration,
you'll
be
able
to
measure
things
like
how
many
visitors
came
to
your
website
each
day,
which
websites
they
came
to
yours
from,
what
countries
they
are
in,
and
what
devices
they
are
using
to
view
your
site.
Here
are
some
of
the
more
important
metrics
you�ll
see
within
Google
Analytics,
and
how
you
should
act
on
them:
Sessions:
This
is
how
many
times
your
site
was
visited
each
day.
If
you
see
a
sudden
surge
or
drop,
it�s
worth
understanding
why
�
dig
into
your
�acquisition�
metrics
to
narrow
down
which
source
of
traffic
changed.
If
it�s
across
the
board,
then
this
might
indicate
a
technical
problem
with
your
website
that
needs
fixing.
However,
you
shouldn�t
necessarily
panic
if
this
drops,
or
congratulate
yourself
if
it
increases.
Sessions
don�t
pay
the
bills;
it�s
the
quality
of
that
traffic
that
matters.
Conversions:
Once
you�ve
set
up
goals
in
Google
Analytics
tied
to
people
actually
giving
you
money,
or
doing
something
that
is
a
good
proxy
for
giving
you
money,
this
is
the
main
thing
you
want
to
focus
on.
Google
Analytics
allows
you
to
break
down
your
conversion
data
by
location
and
source,
and
to
analyze
the
path
users
took
before
they
completed
your
conversion
actions.
Trends
that
you
see
in
your
conversion
data
will
affect
your
bottom
line
and
your
livelihood,
so
it
is
critical
to
monitor,
understand,
and
act
upon
this
data.
If
conversions
for
a
specific
product
are
dropping,
you
need
to
figure
out
how
to
boost
its
marketing,
make
the
product
more
appealing,
make
its
web
page
more
likely
to
convert,
and/or
abandon
it
in
favor
of
creating
a
better
product.
Average
Time
on
Page:
This
is
a
measure
of
user
engagement
with
your
site.
If
it�s
dropping,
then
the
traffic
you
are
attracting
to
your
website
isn�t
really
interested
in
what
you
have
to
offer.
Evaluate
your
marketing
efforts,
and
whether
they
are
really
reaching
the
right
people.
A
drop
in
this
metric
may
also
indicate
a
rise
in
malicious
traffic
to
your
site,
which
you
may
need
to
block.
Channels:
This
section,
under
�acquisition�,
lets
you
break
down
your
traffic
by
where
it
came
from.
You
may
see
data
for
sessions
that
originated
from
direct
traffic
(someone
typed
your
URL
into
the
address
bar,)
organic
(free)
search,
paid
search,
display
ads,
social
media,
or
referrals
from
other
sites.
The
balance
between
free
and
paid
traffic
is
good
to
understand,
as
it
lets
you
know
how
important
those
paid
advertisements
really
are
to
your
business.
Ideally
you�d
want
your
traffic
to
grow
over
time,
but
come
increasingly
from
free
sources
like
good
SEO
and
PR
practices.
This
view
also
makes
it
easy
to
determine
the
return
on
investment
on
your
paid
advertising,
which
may
influence
your
decisions
on
whether
to
spend
more
or
less
on
it.
Digging
into
the
�referral�
channel
can
also
be
interesting;
as
it
lets
you
know
what
other
websites
are
driving
traffic
to
yours.

Often,
you�ll
discover
online
discussions
about
your
product
in
this
manner,
and
this
is
an
opportunity
to
go
chime
in
yourself
as
the
owner
of
the
company
and
keep
the
discussion
going.
INTERPRETING
YOUR
METRICS
If
you
do
one
thing
beyond
the
basic
integration
of
Google
Analytics,
make
it
setting
up
"goals".
This
can
currently
be
done
from
the
Administration
menu.
You
tag
your
site
with
certain
events
that
tell
Google
Analytics
when
a
customer
does
something
valuable�
like
purchasing
a
product,
downloading
an
evaluation
or
white
paper,
etc.

Armed
with
that
information,
you
can
not
only
see
the
effect
your
marketing
efforts
are
having
on
traffic
to
your
site,
but
the
impact
they
are
having
on
sales.
There
is
good
website
traffic,
and
there
is
bad
traffic.
Looking
at
visitors
or
page
views
alone
can
be
very
misleading.
Perhaps
you
have
an
ad
that
is
attention-grabbing,
but
reaching
the
wrong
people�
they
come
to
your
website,
but
never
buy
anything.
Visitor
data
can
also
be
polluted
by
malicious
traffic,
such
as
referrer
spam13
or
click
fraud.
Or
maybe
you
have
an
ad
on
a
display
network
that
got
picked
up
by
some
mobile
app
that
tricks
its
customers
into
clicking
on
it,
resulting
in
more
junk
traffic
to
your
site.
It's
those
goals,
also
referred
to
as
conversions
in
Google
Analytics,
which
you
should
be
focusing
on�
not
page
views
or
visits.
View
your
web
metrics
with
skepticism.
Many
times
I've
been
excited
to
see
a
surge
in
traffic
to
my
website,
only
to
find
that
it's
all
coming
from
a
country
that
doesn�t
even
speak
English
and
is
likely
part
of
some
click
fraud
ring.
Other
times,
it's
a
surge
in
referrer
spam.
Always
dig
into
what
drove
a
change
in
your
metrics�
view
the
traffic
by
country,
and
by
referrer,
to
make
sure
it
is
legitimate.
A
drop
in
traffic
or
conversions
however
is
worth
digging
into.
It
could
be
indicative
of
a
technical
problem
with
your
website,
a
change
to
search
engine
algorithms
that
affected
you,
an
important
referrer
dropped
their
link
to
your
site,
or
it
could
just
mean
that
you
haven't
spent
enough
time
on
marketing
lately.
Checking
your
Google
Analytics
metrics
every
day
is
sure
to
shake
you
into
action
when
things
are
not
heading
in
the
right
direction.
Be
sure
to
look
at
long
term
as
well
as
short
term
trends.
Don't
just
focus
on
data
from
the
past
week,
as
it
will
be
easy
to
overlook
a
longer-term
increase
or
decrease
in
your
business.
It's
those
long-term
trends
that
are
the
hardest
to
turn
around,
so
you
need
to
be
aware
of
them
if
they
exist,
understand
what's
driving
them,
and
do
something
about
them
if
your
business
is
to
survive.
Perhaps
your
product
is
simply
losing
its
relevance
in
the
marketplace
slowly
over
time,
despite
your
best
efforts
to
market
it.
Doubling
down
further
on
marketing
is
not
the
answer
in
that
case�
the
answer
is
to
start
building
a
new
product
that
addresses
the
new
problems
your
customers
need
to
solve.
Tying
your
sales
information
to
Google
Analytics
lets
you
make
very
precise
statements
about
the
return
on
investment
for
various
marketing
efforts.
Armed
with
that
data,
you
can
do
more
of
what's
effective
for
your
business,
and
less
of
what's
not.
Metrics
for
your
website
aren't
the
only
metrics
you
should
be
following,
of
course.
Use
the
reports
in
whatever
accounting
package
you
are
using
to
ensure
your
cash
flow
is
stable,
your
revenue
is
growing,
and
your
expenses
are
under
control.
Keep
an
eye
on
your
business
bank
account,
and
have
a
number
in
mind
below
which
you
start
to
get
worried.
It's
easy
to
overspend
on
advertising,
and
it's
easy
for
markets
to
change
or
for
competitors
to
eat
into
your
business�
requiring
you
to
build
a
new
product
before
revenue
from
the
old
one
completely
dries
up.
Ultimately,
your
sales
revenue
trends
are
the
best
indicator
of
when
that
needs
to
be
done.
TRACKING
AND
CLOSING
SALES
As
a
new
business
owner,
you'll
probably
hear
about
"CRM"
solutions
such
as
salesforce.com,
Zoho,
and
many
others.
CRM
stands
for
Customer
Relationship
Management,
and
it�s
really
just
a
fancy
term
for
a
sales
database.
It
is
important
that
you
keep
track
of
your
sales
somewhere.
You
want
to
be
able
to
contact
your
past
customers
if
you
need
to,
or
just
to
let
them
know
about
new
products
of
interest
to
them.
But,
you
may
be
able
to
get
by
with
just
a
spreadsheet
at
first.
There's
no
need
to
invest
in
an
expensive
CRM
system
until
you've
got
a
handle
on
how
sales
of
your
product
are
driven.
These
systems
are
geared
toward
full-time
sales
people
who
mine
leads,
make
cold
calls,
and
follow
up
with
their
prospects
until
they
close
a
sale.
If
you've
followed
my
advice
however,
your
products
sell
themselves
on
the
Internet
through
your
automated
targeted
online
ads.
Investing
lots
of
your
time
into
each
individual
sale
simply
does
not
scale
when
you're
a
one
person
company,
especially
when
your
market
is
large
and
worldwide.
Your
sales
process
needs
to
be
as
automated
as
possible.
Email
campaigns
can
be
used
to
close
sales
automatically.
Most
email
platforms
allow
you
to
set
up
automatic
rules
to
send
a
series
of
pre-written
emails
over
time
to
new
customers
when
they
are
added
to
your
mailing
list.
For
example,
once
a
potential
customer
signs
up
for
a
trial
of
your
product,
you
can
automatically
email
that
person
a
few
days
later
to
ask
how
it's
going,
and
to
offer
some
tips
for
getting
the
most
out
of
the
trial.
Just
prior
to
the
end
of
the
trial
period,
that
customer
can
receive
another
automated
email
reminding
them
it's
time
to
purchase
it.
Your
customers
are
busy,
and
they
need
these
reminders.
A
computer
can
send
those
reminders
just
as
well
as
a
human
being
can�
once
a
human
being
has
written
the
form-letter
emails
once.
It's
good
to
include
contact
information
if
they
do
want
to
talk
to
you,
but
most
people
just
need
a
little
nudge.
That
nudge
can
make
a
real
difference
in
your
sales.
Automated
systems
like
MailChimp
can
send
as
many
of
those
nudges
as
you
need,
at
very
low
cost
and
while
you
sleep.

AVOIDING
PITFALLS
Small
businesses
are
a
significant
part
of
the
economy.

According
to
the
US
Small
Business
Administration,
46%
of
the
United
States'
gross
domestic
product
comes
from
small
business.
There
is
a
lot
of
money
in
our
world�
and
that
means
there
are
also
predators
looking
to
take
some
of
it
from
you.
This
section
lists
a
few
things
to
watch
out
for.
BEWARE
OF
LEECHES
Being
a
new
business
owner
is
intimidating.
No
matter
how
good
you
were
in
your
corporate
career,
it
left
you
largely
unprepared
for
launching
a
business
of
your
own.
When
people
emerge
who
are
willing
to
help
you
get
started,
it
can
seem
like
good
fortune�
but
be
wary.
Very
wary.
There
are
often
local
entrepreneurs
who
became
successful,
and
genuinely
want
to
give
their
experience
back
to
the
community.
Those
are
the
sorts
of
people
you
want
to
talk
to.
You
can
usually
identify
them
by
their
willingness
to
help
you
for
free.
There
are
predators
out
there
that
look
for
new
business
owners,
and
try
to
scam
them
out
of
ownership
of
their
business.
If
someone
you
only
met
recently
wants
to
be
your
partner,
be
on
your
board
of
directors,
or
be
your
co-founder�
don't
do
it.
Once
you've
signed
an
agreement
with
this
person
that
gives
them
some
percentage
of
your
company,
you'll
probably
never
hear
from
them
again
until
it's
time
for
them
to
collect
their
money.
Even
if
you
decide
to
share
your
company
with
someone
who
is
generally
well-meaning,
taking
on
partners
can
still
go
very
wrong.
What
happens
if
your
partner
gets
a
divorce?
Could
their
share
of
the
company
end
up
getting
transferred
to
their
spouse,
who
will
now
be
your
new
partner,
like
it
or
not?
What
happens
if
they
die?
What
happens
if
they
just
lose
interest
in
your
company
after
a
few
months
and
stop
contributing
in
a
meaningful
manner?
It's
possible
to
create
a
legal
agreement
that
addresses
these
contingencies,
but
it's
best
to
just
avoid
the
situation
entirely.
Even
sharing
your
company
with
your
spouse
can
be
a
bad
idea.
Apart
from
the
obvious
problem
of
what
happens
if
you
get
divorced
for
whatever
reason,
it
can
create
problems
if
you
end
up
selling
your
company
later
on.
Whoever
is
interested
in
purchasing
your
company
wants
to
deal
with
a
single
decision-maker,
and
if
you've
split
ownership
of
your
company
50/50
with
your
spouse,
they
now
need
to
deal
with
both
of
you.
Some
acquirers
would
just
walk
away.
It
makes
sense
to
seek
outside
expertise
on
areas
that
are
crucial
to
your
business,
and
complement
your
own
knowledge
with
those
of
others.
But
that
expertise
usually
can
be
had
for
free
through
your
local
business
incubator,
economic
development
council,
or
Meetup
groups.
Professional
services
can
be
purchased
on
an
hourly
basis.
Giving
up
a
percentage
of
a
lifestyle
business
rarely
makes
sense,
and
it
ties
you
down
unnecessarily.
Growth
businesses
are
another
beast
entirely�
if
someone
is
giving
you
outside
investment,
it's
reasonable
that
they
will
want
a
cut
of
your
company
and
some
control
over
it
in
return.
This
book
isn't
about
growth
businesses.
If
you're
unsure
whether
your
company
is
a
growth
business
or
a
lifestyle
business,
you
must
achieve
clarity
on
your
long-term
plans
for
your
company
and
your
own
life
first.
If
you
know
your
goal
is
a
lifestyle
business
to
maximize
your
personal
freedom
in
the
long
run,
then
you
know
you
must
plan
to
avoid
outside
investment
and
retain
full
ownership
of
your
business.
BEWARE
OF
WELL-MEANING
ADVICE
If
you
do
get
involved
with
the
local
community
of
small-business
owners,
you'll
probably
get
more
free
advice
than
you
know
what
to
do
with.
That's
great�
but
it's
easy
to
let
it
become
distracting.
At
first,
it
may
seem
like
all
small
business
owners
are
faced
with
the
same
challenges.
But
most
businesses
are
not
like
yours.
Remember
most
small
business
owners
are
primarily
selling
products
or
services
locally�
if
you
are
selling
your
goods
globally
over
the
Internet,
then
what
works
for
them
won't
work
for
you.
Even
if
they
are
selling
on
the
Internet,
their
customers
may
be
very
different
from
yours.
Always
consider
advice
through
the
lens
of
"how
similar
is
this
person's
business
to
my
own?"
It's
great
to
receive
unsolicited
advice,
but
it's
even
better
to
seek
out
other
small
business
owners
yourself
that
do
run
businesses
similar
to
your
own.
As
long
as
you're
not
competing
with
them,
they'll
probably
be
happy
to
offer
whatever
advice
you
want
over
coffee
or
a
phone
call.
I've
said
this
before
in
this
book,
but
it
bears
repeating.
Here's
a
real
example.
When
I
started
my
own
business,
I
heard
a
lot
about
the
importance
of
sales
efforts.
You
know,
gathering
lists
of
prospects,
making
cold
calls,
doing
in-house
demos,
and
following
up
to
close
sales.

Through
my
local
business
incubator,
I
met
lots
of
other
business
owners
who
testified
to
the
importance
of
these
techniques.
Based
on
their
advice,
I
was
convinced
that
having
a
real
sales
team
was
crucial
to
my
business's
success.
Trouble
is,
those
other
companies
relied
almost
entirely
on
sales
within
their
local
area,
and
they
were
selling
big-ticket
products
and
services
that
cost
tens
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
Furthermore,
their
customers
are
in
industries
where
they
are
accustomed
to
dealing
with
sales
people
all
the
time.
In
contrast,
my
own
products
are
relatively
inexpensive,
and
sold
globally
through
the
Internet.
Most
of
my
customers
are
software
engineers,
who
hate
nothing
more
than
a
sales
person
wasting
their
time.
At
the
time,
I
failed
to
see
the
distinction,
and
I
found
a
couple
of
people
to
work
on
sales
for
me
on
a
commission
basis.
It
didn't
end
well�
first
of
all,
they
didn't
really
understand
the
niche
my
business
targets,
and
so
most
of
the
prospects
they
identified
were
never
viable
customers
in
the
first
place.
The
ones
they
did
contact
didn't
get
very
far.
In
the
end,
Sundog
Software's
sales
team
lasted
about
two
months,
and
was
just
a
big
waste
of
time
and
effort
during
the
crucial
first
few
months
of
my
business.
After
that,
I
sent
an
email
to
the
CEO
of
a
successful
company
very
similar
to
mine,
and
asked
him
how
he
handled
sales.
He
was
happy
to
help�
and
I
learned
that
he
saw
the
most
success
through
automated
email
campaigns.
Finally,
it
clicked�
but
only
after
seeking
advice
from
the
owners
of
successful
businesses
that
are
very
similar
to
my
own.
He
offered
lots
of
other
advice
as
well,
that
continues
to
influence
the
path
of
my
company
today.
Keep
in
mind
that
business
advice
you
get
locally
is
likely
to
only
be
relevant
locally,
and
within
the
businesses
your
peers
are
in.

Accept
all
the
advice
you
can,
but
filter
it
accordingly.
That
goes
for
this
book
too�
what
worked
for
me
is
what
worked
for
an
online-based
software
product
business.
If
your
business
is
completely
different,
you
need
to
ask
yourself
if
your
unique
customer
needs
result
in
some
of
my
advice
being
more
important
than
others.
BEWARE
OF
HIRING
SALESPEOPLE
I've
already
given
you
my
horror
story
on
sales
people
above,
but
it's
one
I've
heard
repeatedly
from
others�
including
from
career
sales
people!
I
was
fortunate
that
all
I
lost
was
some
time
with
my
experiment
in
sales.
However,
the
sales
person
I
worked
with
originally
wanted
a
share
of
the
company
in
exchange
for
his
efforts.
Had
I
agreed,
I�d
be
burdened
with
that
drain
on
my
company
with
nothing
in
exchange.
Despite
how
comfortable
or
not
you
are
with
sales,
the
best
sales
person
for
your
company
is
you.
When
someone
knows
they're
talking
to
the
CEO,
they
pay
a
little
more
attention�
even
if
you're
just
the
CEO
of
yourself.
Nobody
will
be
more
informed
about
your
products
and
your
business
than
you
are,
and
nobody
else
has
the
authority
to
cut
deals
on
the
spot.
My
own
approach
was
to
mainly
automate
sales
and
just
focus
on
closing
people
who
had
questions
about
my
products.
Even
if
you
can't
do
that
for
your
business,
you
need
to
put
off
hiring
sales
people
as
long
as
possible.
The
main
issue
is
that
it's
very
hard
to
hire
a
good
salesperson.
These
people
are
trained
at
mental
manipulation,
and
they
know
how
to
sell
themselves
just
as
well
as
they
can
sell
any
product.
If
you've
never
done
any
sales
work
yourself,
then
you
have
no
way
to
really
evaluate
them
or
know
what
questions
to
ask
them.
It's
just
too
easy
to
get
won
over
by
a
salesperson
that
will
ultimately
be
ineffective,
and
waste
a
lot
of
your
precious
bootstrap
money
in
the
process.
Good
salespeople
won't
just
work
on
commission
either,
so
don't
think
you
can
just
try
someone
out
without
any
risk.
If
someone
offers
to
work
on
sales
for
your
small
company
without
a
salary,
they
may
have
an
ulterior
motive
�
like
negotiating
an
ownership
stake
in
your
company.
A
salesperson
you
don't
even
know
who
offers
to
work
for
some
percentage
of
your
company
is
probably
a
scammer
of
some
sort,
and
you
should
run
away
quickly.
Remember
your
goal
is
to
build
a
lifestyle
business
that
maximizes
your
personal
freedom.
Being
tied
down
by
employees
or
partners
that
deliver
questionable
value
is
not
a
decision
that
should
be
taken
lightly.
Can
you
really
find
a
salesperson
that
is
knowledgeable
about
the
specific
niche
your
product
targets?
If
not,
they
may
end
up
doing
more
harm
than
good
to
your
company's
reputation.
Within
a
small
niche,
that
reputation
can
spread
quickly.
The
only
person
who
really
has
the
depth
required
to
answer
technical
questions
from
your
customers
is
probably
you;
other
people
may
be
useful
in
identifying
leads,
but
you�re
the
best
person
to
actually
talk
to
them.
If
you
want
to
ramp
up
your
sales
efforts
without
taking
on
all
the
risk
associated
with
a
salesperson,
there
are
alternatives.
Can
you
hire
a
college
student
temporarily
to
just
mine
LinkedIn
or
other
sources
for
sales
leads,
which
are
then
handed
to
you?
That
time-consuming
prospecting
work
can
often
be
outsourced,
allowing
you
to
spend
one
day
per
week
actually
talking
to,
or
emailing,
leads
that
you
have
pre-qualified.
Identifying
leads
is
something
you
can
outsource
at
low
cost,
but
closing
them
is
not.
BEWARE
OF
PRESSURE
TO
HIRE
You'll
find
that
many
people
measure
the
success
of
a
business
by
how
many
people
it
employs.
This
can
be
distracting.
Remember,
hiring
is
not
your
goal
with
a
lifestyle
business.
Your
goal
is
your
own
independence
and
financial
freedom.
Hiring
people
you
don't
need
compromises
all
of
that.
This
can
seem
to
present
an
ethical
dilemma,
if
you
are
taking
advantage
of
local
government-funded
resources
for
small
business
owners.
The
goal
of
those
resources
is
to
create
more
local
jobs
by
encouraging
small
business
growth.
By
taking
advantage
of
these
resources,
yet
avoiding
hiring
as
much
as
possible,
it
seems
like
you're
not
keeping
your
end
of
the
bargain.
But,
you
are
keeping
your
end
of
the
bargain.
As
your
business
grows,
you
certainly
won't
be
able
to
do
it
all
yourself.
This
book
simply
advocates
using
contractors
whenever
possible
instead
of
full
time
employees,
in
order
to
preserve
your
freedom
and
flexibility.
So,
when
someone
asks
you
"how
many
people
do
you
employ?"
tell
them
about
the
number
of
contractors
you're
keeping
in
business.
If
you
try
to
hire
those
contractors
locally,
you're
still
doing
your
part
to
grow
the
local
economy.
You
can
also
talk
about
your
company's
revenue
or
net
profit.
Even
if
most
of
that
money
is
going
directly
to
you,
some
of
it
still
flows
through
to
the
local
economy
through
the
local
goods
and
services
you
purchase.
Your
success
is
not
measured
by
the
number
of
W2
tax
forms
you
give
out
each
year.
Sometimes
you
need
to
help
others
understand
that,
or
even
remind
yourself
of
it.
BEWARE
OF
MISLEADING
STATISTICS
This
pitfall
has
already
been
discussed
in
"Measure
and
Act,"
but
it's
a
big
one.
Making
decisions
based
on
metrics
is
a
good
idea,
but
small
businesses
tend
to
have
relatively
small
numbers
that
they
are
working
with.
As
such,
your
metrics
are
easily
polluted
by
noise
and
random
variations.
One
new
click
fraud
ring,
or
the
disappearance
of
a
referrer
spammer,
can
be
enough
to
move
your
web
metrics
significantly.
Your
sales
revenue
probably
sees
more
variation
each
month
due
to
chance
or
seasonal
effects
than
from
anything
you've
done�
especially
if
you
are
in
a
business
with
long
sales
cycles.
It
is
therefore
important
to
look
not
only
at
short-term,
but
long-term
metrics
related
to
your
business.
How
does
this
entire
quarter's
sales
look
like
compared
to
the
same
quarter
last
year?
Are
there
disturbing
trends
in
my
web
metrics
if
I
look
back
a
full
year?
The
more
data
you
can
aggregate
together,
the
less
susceptible
it
will
be
to
outliers
when
you're
analyzing
it.
If
you�re
going
to
be
making
decisions
that
affect
your
livelihood
based
on
statistics,
you
need
to
have
at
least
a
basic
understanding
of
statistics.
Get
a
�Statistics
for
Dummies�
book
(it�s
actually
pretty
good,)
take
a
course
on
Udemy,
Coursera,
or
at
the
community
college
�
whatever
works
for
you.
At
a
minimum,
learn
what
standard
deviation
is
and
how
to
measure
whether
data
is
likely
just
noise
or
a
real
trend.
Also,
remember
the
most
reliable
metrics
are
the
ones
where
money
is
involved.
How
many
people
visit
your
website
is
easily
gamed;
the
amount
of
money
people
spend
on
your
website
is
not.
The
balance
in
your
business
checking
account
is
gospel.
Here's
a
real
example:
I
recently
congratulated
myself
on
the
success
of
a
new
AdWords
campaign,
set
up
to
target
people
similar
to
those
who
visited
my
website.
Its
cost-per-action
(CPA)
was
lower
than
any
other
ad
campaign
I
had,
so
I
decided
to
invest
more
money
into
it,
believing
it
was
giving
me
a
great
return.
The
problem
is
that
the
"action"
I
was
measuring
for
CPA
was
not
directly
tied
to
money�
it
was
tied
to
downloading
a
demo
of
my
product.
When
I
dug
deeper
into
why
this
ad
campaign
was
doing
so
well,
I
discovered
that
almost
all
of
its
traffic
was
coming
from
China,
Iraq,
and
Vietnam.
Exactly
zero
traffic
was
coming
from
the
United
States.
Given
that
my
website
and
product
documentation
is
all
in
English,
it's
safe
to
say
that
the
majority
of
those
actions
were
in
fact
worthless
in
the
end,
and
something
was
probably
gaming
this
campaign
somehow.
I
made
the
wrong
decision
on
how
to
spend
my
advertising
dollars
as
a
result
of
this
misleading
statistic�
most
of
it
probably
ended
up
with
some
click
fraud
ring
in
China.
After
blocking
those
countries,
this
ad
campaign
became
more
effective.
Question
suspicious
results
that
aren't
directly
tied
to
customer
spending,
and
don't
let
short-term
variance
affect
your
decision
making
without
also
looking
at
longer-term
trends.


BUILDING
A
GROWTH
ENGINE
It
takes
constant
effort
to
keep
your
lifestyle
business
thriving.
You
may
have
started
your
company
with
one
great
idea,
but
that
idea
won't
stay
successful
forever.
The
needs
of
your
customers
may
change
over
time,
and
you
may
even
saturate
your
market
at
some
point.
You
always
need
to
be
trying
out
new
ideas
in
order
to
maintain
the
financial
security
your
business
provides
in
years
to
come.
You're
in
this
for
the
long
run,
and
so
you
need
to
build
a
metaphorical
engine
that
keeps
your
business
growing
over
time.
FINDING
THE
TIME
Creating,
marketing,
and
supporting
one
product
is
a
lot
of
work�
how
do
you
find
time
to
try
out
new
ones
at
the
same
time?
This
is
why
it's
important
to
automate
and
outsource
as
much
of
what
you
do
as
possible.
As
a
business
owner,
you
need
to
adopt
a
new
mindset
for
how
you
spend
your
time.
Every
time
you
find
yourself
starting
a
new
task,
you
must
ask
yourself
if
your
time
would
be
better
spent
developing
a
new
product,
or
doing
whatever
it
is
you
are
doing.
For
example,
let's
say
you
have
a
new
product
idea.
Conservatively,
you
believe
it
could
generate
around
$50,000
per
year
in
new
profits,
and
would
take
about
three
months
of
your
full
time
effort
to
bring
it
to
market.

If
you
do
the
math,
that
works
out
to
a
return
of
about
$104
per
hour
just
in
the
first
year.
Let's
assume
this
product
can
bring
in
revenue
for
at
least
3
years�
now
we're
up
to
$312
that
one
hour
of
your
time
is
worth,
if
you're
working
on
that
new
product.
What
were
you
planning
to
do
instead
of
working
on
this
new
product
idea?
If
you
could
pay
someone
else
to
do
it
for
less
than
$300
per
hour,
and
you
have
the
cash
to
do
so,
then
you
clearly
should.
Now,
you
do
need
to
be
mindful
of
your
cash
flow.
Paying
others
to
take
care
of
aspects
of
your
existing
business
in
order
to
free
up
your
own
time
is
basically
bootstrapping
another
business.
Doing
that
takes
money
up
front.
From
a
practical
standpoint,
you
need
to
be
careful
about
how
much
you're
spending
on
contractors
and
other
outside
help.
Look
at
your
current
cash
flow
situation,
and
decide
how
much
you
can
spend
per
month
on
outside
help
while
still
having
a
few
months
of
reserve
cash
on
hand.
Even
if
outsourcing
work
makes
sense
financially
in
the
long
run,
it
won't
matter
if
you
bankrupt
your
business
before
those
new
products
hit
the
market.
So,
farm
out
what
you
can�
but
don't
bet
the
farm
on
it
either.
Figure
out
an
upper
bound
per
month
that
you
can
afford
to
spend
on
outside
help,
and
stick
to
it.
Automation
is
even
better
than
outsourcing.
Is
there
some
task
you
spend
a
lot
of
your
time
on
that
could
be
automated?
Perhaps
aspects
of
your
sales
and
marketing,
like
sending
out
follow-up
emails
to
new
customers,
or
allowing
customers
to
get
the
information
or
products
they
need
in
a
self-service
manner.
Think
about
the
time
you
spend
automating
your
work
in
a
return-on-investment
standpoint
as
well;
how
much
time
per
year
would
automating
this
task
save,
compared
to
the
amount
of
time
it
would
take
to
automate
it?
What
is
that
extra
time
worth?
What
needs
to
sink
in
is
this:
your
time
is
almost
always
better
spent
developing
a
new
product
than
doing
something
else.
It
will
probably
earn
more
money
in
the
long
run
than
taking
on
extra
freelance
work.
Adding
new
features
to
an
existing
product
also
won't
present
as
much
of
a
return
as
building
a
new
product
might.
Not
all
of
your
new
product
ideas
will
succeed,
but
think
like
a
venture
capitalist�
try
as
many
good
ideas
as
you
can,
and
if
you
have
enough,
some
of
them
will
be
hits.
The
key
is
to
get
them
out
to
market
as
quickly
as
possible
so
you
can
try
as
many
ideas
as
you
can.
Always
think
critically
of
the
return
on
investment
you
are
getting
on
your
time.
It
is
the
one
resource
you
cannot
make
more
of;
spending
it
wisely
is
the
key
to
growing
your
business.
You
must
find
ways
to
minimize
the
time
it
takes
to
support
your
existing
products,
in
order
to
free
up
time
to
create
new
ones.
Support
and
expand
your
existing
products
only
as
long
as
they
are
profitable,
and
have
new
ones
ready
to
take
their
place.
To
do
this,
you
need
to
plan
in
advance
for
the
decline
of
your
products.
It
sounds
pessimistic,
but
it
is
necessary.
If
you
have
agreements
with
your
customers
that
promise
support
in
perpetuity,
you
will
never
be
able
to
discontinue
that
product.
Make
sure
any
end
user
license
agreements
and
contracts
are
explicitly
time-bound
for
any
support
you
will
provide.
Otherwise,
you
won�t
have
time
to
develop
and
support
new
products
that
are
more
relevant
to
your
evolving
markets.
FINDING
THE
PEOPLE
If
you
do
need
to
hire
contractors,
finding
the
right
ones
is
crucial.
A
bad
contractor
can
burn
up
thousands
of
dollars
while
accomplishing
nothing,
or
building
the
wrong
thing.
You
may
have
hired
someone
on
the
presumption
that
your
time
is
more
valuable
than
the
rate
you
are
paying
them
�
but
if
you
could
have
done
what
they
are
doing
in
a
quarter
of
the
time,
then
you
aren�t
coming
out
ahead.
Using
referrals
through
LinkedIn
or
other
social
networks
can
help.
If
someone
you
trust
has
used
a
contractor
successfully,
that
means
a
lot.
For
more
routine
tasks,
there
are
websites
like
Elance
that
offer
contractors
with
customer
ratings
you
can
look
at.
However,
still
start
carefully
with
a
new
contractor,
regardless
of
how
well
they
are
recommended.
Start
with
a
very
small,
well-defined
task,
with
a
strict
upper
bound
on
the
cost
or
number
of
hours
you
are
willing
to
spend
on
it.
Make
sure
this
number
is
one
you
are
comfortable
potentially
losing.
If
the
contractor
meets
your
expectations,
you
can
start
outsourcing
larger
tasks
as
your
budget
permits.
If
not,
then
you
haven�t
lost
much.
Take
advantage
of
the
flexible
and
temporary
relationship
of
a
contractor
in
order
to
try
them
out
before
committing
to
larger
projects.
Make
sure
your
contractors
have
a
contract!
Your
lawyer
can
provide
one,
or
there
are
many
boilerplate
contracts
available
on
the
web
you
can
adapt
to
your
needs.
The
important
points
are
to
be
very
clear
on
the
deliverables,
when
they
are
due,
when
and
how
payment
will
be
made,
who
owns
the
resulting
intellectual
property,
and
where
the
work
will
be
performed.
It
must
also
be
clear
that
the
contractor
is
responsible
for
their
own
benefits
and
taxes
and
is
using
their
own
equipment.
If
you
are
providing
equipment
and/or
a
workplace
for
your
contractors,
the
IRS
may
question
if
they
are
in
fact
employees
instead
�
and
that�s
a
headache
you
don�t
need.
In
the
US,
remember
to
get
a
W9
form
from
them,
so
you�ll
know
how
to
fill
out
their
1099
form
at
tax
time.
FINDING
THE
IDEAS
We've
established
that
working
on
new
product
ideas
is
a
good
use
of
your
time,
but
that
assumes
your
new
product
idea
is
viable.
How
do
you
find
viable
ideas?
A
good
place
to
start
is
with
your
existing
customers
of
your
existing
products.
They
already
have
a
relationship
with
you�
hopefully
a
positive
one!
If
you
can
build
more
products
that
meet
their
needs,
it
will
be
a
lot
easier
to
sell
them
to
existing
customers
than
to
find
new
ones.
That
can
get
your
new
product
out
of
the
gates
running.
So,
take
a
customer
to
lunch.
Have
a
phone
conversation.
Send
out
an
online
survey.
It's
OK
to
have
them
evaluate
some
product
ideas
of
your
own,
but
even
better
is
just
to
ask
them
"what
problems
keep
you
up
at
night?"
Those
are
the
sorts
of
problems
people
shell
out
money
to
solve.
Not
only
can
you
build
off
your
existing
customer
base
to
grow
your
business,
you
can
also
build
off
your
existing
products.
Is
there
some
aspect
of
the
manufacturing
or
creation
of
your
current
products
that
would
make
it
easy
to
create
new
ones?
I
did
this
with
the
software
development
kits
my
company
sells�
realizing
that
the
market
of
software
developers
was
relatively
small,
I
used
my
own
software
to
develop
add-ons
for
a
popular
flight
simulator
game.

With
a
few
months
of
effort,
I
was
able
to
leverage
the
years
that
went
into
developing
that
software
to
create
a
highly
competitive
product
for
flight
simulation
enthusiasts.
Today,
this
derivative
product
brings
in
over
$100,000
per
year
in
revenue�
and
the
up-front
costs
were
just
a
few
months
of
my
development
effort.
Perhaps
your
company
sells
physical
products,
and
the
manufacturing,
distribution,
sales,
and
marketing
you
worked
so
hard
to
establish
can
be
mostly
re-used
to
sell
another
product.
Find
ways
to
leverage
the
initial
development
costs
of
your
earlier
products
to
bring
new
ones
to
market
quickly
and
cheaply.
Are
there
new
markets
for
your
existing
products
you
haven't
considered?
Perhaps
a
little
bit
of
re-packaging
is
all
you
need.
My
software
products
were
initially
targeted
toward
developers
of
training
and
simulation
systems.
All
it
took
was
a
weekend
of
caffeine-fueled
coding
to
launch
a
variation
of
those
products
targeted
to
video
game
developers.
That
weekend
of
effort
ended
up
generating
about
$1000
per
month
for
years.
Not
huge
money,
but
it
was
definitely
a
good
return
on
the
investment
of
my
time.
One
hour
that
weekend
created
$1,800
over
the
following
three
years.
Not
a
bad
hourly
pay
rate!
Finally,
be
open
to
completely
new
product
ideas
for
completely
new
customers
as
well.
Your
company�s
mission
statement
isn�t
cast
in
stone
�
if
new
business
opportunities
present
themselves,
and
you�re
in
a
position
to
execute
on
them
without
risking
much,
why
not?
Sundog
Software
isn�t
just
selling
software
these
days;
it�s
also
experimenting
with
online
courses
in
the
areas
I�m
knowledgeable
about,
and
selling
books
on
starting
a
business!
Both
of
those
ideas
came
through
my
personal
connections
and
networking
efforts,
along
with
the
opportunity
to
try
them
out.
I
don�t
know
if
they
will
pay
off,
but
if
they
do,
it
could
result
in
my
company
pivoting
in
a
big
way
�
with
no
initial
cost
other
than
some
of
my
time.
THE
COMPOUNDING
EFFECT
You
don't
need
to
be
an
accounting
genius
to
see
how
this
mentality
can
lead
to
great
rewards
year
after
year.
If
every
year
you
launch
a
new
product
that
generates
$100,000
per
year�
you'll
be
making
a
million
dollars
per
year,
every
year,
after
ten
years.
That's
much
easier
said
than
done;
not
all
of
your
products
will
be
a
smashing
success
and
revenue
from
older
products
will
likely
decline
over
time.
But
if
you
have
the
discipline
to
always
be
launching
new
products,
they
can
create
ongoing
revenue
streams
for
you
that
just
keep
adding
together
year
after
year.
It
takes
hard
work
and
diligence,
but
forcing
yourself
to
find
time
to
launch
new
product
ideas
is
what
leads
to
long-term
wealth.
Increasing
the
sales
of
an
existing
product
by
20%
can
take
a
lot
of
work.
Launching
a
new
product
that
sells
more
than
20%
of
your
existing
product
may
be
a
lot
easier.
Even
if
you
only
achieve
20%
growth
every
year�
that's
a
much
better
return
than
you'd
get
from
the
stock
market,
or
from
pay
raises
in
a
corporate
job.
I
don't
want
you
leave
this
book
thinking
it's
some
sort
of
get-rich-quick
scheme.
In
reality,
solo-preneurs
that
earn
over
a
million
dollars
per
year
are
incredibly
rare.
I
know
exactly
one,
personally.
All
those
new
products
take
time
to
support,
and
there
are
only
so
many
tasks
you
can
outsource
or
automate.
Your
available
time
will
ultimately
place
an
upper
bound
on
your
earnings,
not
to
mention
the
quality
of
your
ideas
and
your
ability
to
execute
on
every
aspect
of
building
them
and
promoting
them.
If
you
start
hitting
the
wall
of
your
own
time,
you
need
to
decide
whether
to
hire
others
to
continue
growing
your
business,
or
be
content
with
maintaining
the
cash
flow�
and
personal
freedom�
you
have
already
achieved.
That
is
what
is
known
as
a
good
problem
to
have.

I
do
want
you
to
leave
this
book
understanding
that
working
for
yourself
is
a
realistic
path
to
a
rich
lifestyle.
You
don't
need
a
million
dollars
per
year
to
live
as
comfortably
as
you
can
reasonably
imagine.
A
2010
study
by
Nobel
laureate
Daniel
Kahneman
showed
that
income
over
$75,000
per
year
doesn�t
actually
increase
personal
happiness.
Earning
$75,000
per
year
from
your
own
business
is
certainly
an
achievable
goal�
and
you'll
have
all
the
benefits
of
being
your
own
boss
as
well.


ADAPTING
TO
YOUR
NEW
LIFE
Successfully
transitioning
to
self-employment
isn't
easy,
but
hopefully
this
book
has
armed
you
with
the
knowledge
you
need
to
do
it
successfully.
If
you
do,
you'll
find
your
lifestyle
is
a
lot
different
than
what
you
were
used
to!
You'll
never
look
at
corporate
employment
the
same
way
again,
and
you'll
enjoy
a
level
of
personal
freedom
you
quite
literally
never
knew
existed.
Even
positive
transitions
aren't
easy,
however.
It
can
take
years
to
adjust
to
your
new
life
and
feel
comfortable
with
it.
I
probably
can't
change
that
for
you,
but
I
can
at
least
tell
you
what
to
expect.
SURVIVOR'S
GUILT
Once
you
realize
you're
able
to
support
yourself
without
the
benefit
of
a
big
corporate
employer,
you'll
probably
be
in
a
little
bit
of
denial.
Perhaps
you
spent
decades
in
the
service
of
others,
trained
to
believe
this
was
a
virtuous
thing
to
do.
You
worked
hard
to
further
your
career,
and
then
threw
your
career
away.
Were
all
of
those
years
wasted?
That's
not
something
you
want
to
believe,
but
you
suspect
it
may
be
true.
How
can
I
face
my
friends
who
still
have
traditional
jobs
and
see
them
in
the
same
way?
They
want
to
talk
about
their
work,
but
it
just
reminds
you
of
a
corporate
career
you
no
longer
look
back
on
fondly.
Yet
they
remain
all-consumed
with
their
careers.
You
don't
want
to
talk
about
how
your
life
has
changed
too
much,
because
it
will
feel
like
you're
gloating.
These
are
difficult
feelings
to
come
to
terms
with.
First
of
all�
the
time
you
spent
in
your
career
was
not
wasted.
You
probably
learned
and
refined
the
very
skills
that
your
business
is
based
on
while
working
for
someone
else.
People
learn
by
doing,
and
accomplishing
that
learning
while
someone
else
is
paying
you
for
it
is
not
a
bad
deal.
You
would
not
be
successful
in
your
own
business
without
the
benefit
of
that
learning
experience
that's
behind
you.
Your
only
regret
should
be
if
you
continued
in
the
same
job
once
it
stopped
offering
new
things
to
learn.
Second,
don't
be
afraid
to
talk
to
your
friends
about
your
new
business.
Answer
their
questions
honestly.
Getting
to
where
you
are
now
wasn't
easy,
and
talking
about
that
path
isn't
gloating.
Maybe
some
of
your
friends
are
at
a
point
in
their
careers
where
they
should
be
launching
businesses
of
their
own
too,
and
hearing
your
story
might
help
them
realize
that.
You
will
feel
a
little
guilty
as
you
make
your
daily
commute
50
feet
from
your
bedroom
to
your
home
office.
You'll
feel
guilty
when
you
take
a
break
by
the
pool
because
you're
mentally
drained
for
the
day,
not
because
the
clock
says
5
PM.
You'll
feel
guilty
on
the
days
when
you
earn
more
money
from
sales
before
breakfast
than
you
used
to
in
an
entire
day
of
work.
You
can't
help
but
think
about
how
most
people
don't
have
such
luxuries,
and
feel
like
you
are
somehow
cheating
the
system.
Your
problems
aren't
even
first-world-problems;
they're
zero-world-problems.
You'll
get
over
it
in
time.
Just
be
thankful
that
these
are
the
things
you
worry
about
now.
LETTING
GO
OF
FIXED
SCHEDULES
If
you
were
a
workaholic
in
your
career,
letting
go
of
the
8-plus-hour-day
can
be
a
particularly
tough
thing
to
do.
As
the
owner
of
your
own
business,
you
only
work
when
it's
needed.
There
will
be
busy
days,
and
there
will
be
slow
days.
Some
days
you
will
have
more
mental
energy
than
others.
If
you
find
yourself
checking
your
social
networks
and
news
for
more
than
a
few
minutes,
then
you
are
filling
time
for
the
sake
of
filling
time.
Nobody
expects
you
to
be
at
your
desk
continuously
during
a
certain
set
of
hours
any
longer;
let
go
of
that
artificial
restriction.
If
you're
not
being
productive,
either
find
a
way
to
be
productive
(like
working
on
a
new
product,)
or
accept
that
you're
done
for
the
day.
Go
do
whatever
it
is
you
do
to
relax
and
recharge.
Nobody's
going
to
stop
you.
Nobody's
going
to
fire
you.
Nobody's
going
to
give
you
a
bad
performance
review.
All
that
matters
is
whether
the
needs
of
your
customers
are
being
met,
and
whether
you
are
taking
appropriate
steps
to
grow
your
business.
That
does
not
need
to
happen
between
the
hours
of
9
AM
and
5
PM.
It
should
happen
whenever
you
have
the
most
energy
and
are
the
most
productive.
Perhaps
you
can
arrange
your
day
such
that
more
menial
tasks
are
done
when
your
energy
level
is
low.
I
usually
try
to
do
challenging
tasks
in
the
morning,
and
take
care
of
things
like
bookkeeping
after
lunch.
By
matching
tasks
to
your
current
energy
level,
sometimes
you
can
make
efficient
use
of
more
hours
in
the
day.
LIVE
A
LITTLE
Remember,
the
whole
point
of
launching
a
lifestyle
business
is
to
improve
your
lifestyle.
Take
advantage
of
what
your
new
life
has
to
offer.
Freed
from
the
burdens
of
commuting,
meetings,
and
the
demands
of
your
employer,
you
now
decide
how
to
spend
your
time.
You
have
rejected
the
notion
of
working
non-stop
for
others
in
pursuit
of
some
undefined
point
in
the
far
future
called
"retirement."
Your
new
life
can
be
better
than
retirement!
Even
spending
all
of
your
time
on
the
beach
gets
boring
pretty
fast
(I
tried
it;
it
lasted
about
three
days).
If
you've
built
your
new
business
around
something
you
enjoy
doing,
then
it's
just
one
more
rewarding
activity
that
you
fill
your
time
with.
And
you'll
have
more
free
time
to
do
all
the
other
things
you
enjoy.
How
many
shows
or
events
have
passed
through
your
city
without
you
giving
them
a
second
thought,
because
you
were
too
busy?
How
many
unique
experiences
does
your
area
have
to
offer?
Have
you
ever
had
time
to
travel
just
for
pleasure?
Have
you
ever
considered
moving
just
for
the
opportunity
to
intimately
experience
someplace
new
and
interesting?
While
you
had
a
job,
your
money
was
probably
spent
mostly
on
things,
because
you
didn't
have
time
to
invest
it
in
experiences.
That
will
change.
If
you've
followed
the
advice
of
this
book,
you'll
have
constructed
a
business
built
around
what
you
love
to
do,
that
you
can
take
with
you
anywhere.
If
even
one
reader
achieves
that
freedom,
then
writing
this
book
was
time
well
spent.
I
wish
you
the
best
of
luck
on
your
journey!
Even
if
now
isn't
the
right
time
for
self-employment
for
you,
remember
it
is
a
real
option
and
something
you
can
start
working
toward
as
your
end
goal.
Your
lifestyle
business
won't
happen
unless
you
make
it
happen,
so
go
build
a
product
and
see
where
it
leads
you!

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This
book
owes
its
polish
to
two
former
colleagues
of
mine,
who
graciously
volunteered
to
spend
hours
of
their
time
providing
meticulous
feedback
and
edits
on
its
first
draft.
I
extend
a
huge
thank-you
to
Aaron
Dykstra,
who
produced
pages
of
detailed
notes.
Aaron�s
feedback
ranged
from
stylistic
improvements,
to
improving
the
flow
and
continuity
of
this
book.
It�s
much
easier
to
read
thanks
to
the
time
he
spent
with
it,
and
his
encouragement
to
add
more
anecdotes
to
tie
my
advice
to
real
world
scenarios.
Michal
Bryc
also
provided
hugely
valuable
feedback,
both
big
and
small.
Michal
spotted
everything
from
typos
to
entire
sections
that
should
have
been
there.
Most
importantly,
he
pushed
me
to
include
even
more
information
and
statistics
to
back
up
the
advice
within
these
pages.
Aaron
and
Michal
both
took
many
valuable
hours
out
of
their
life
for
this
effort,
and
I
can�t
thank
them
enough.
Of
course
I
also
acknowledge
my
family
�
my

Living
a

of
self-employment
wouldn�t
be
