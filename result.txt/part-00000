DISCLAIMER
What
you
do
with
your
career
is
your
own
decision.
This
book
tells
you
how
I
improved
my
life
by
quitting
my
job,
and
creating
a
sustainable
and
growing
income
through
self-employment.
What
I
learned
along
the
way
could
help
you
do
the
same.
But
no
matter
how
much
advice
or
how
many
stories
I
give
you,
in
the
end
success
relies
on
your
own
preparation,
planning,
skillset,
talents,
determination,
and
a
little
bit
of
luck.
I
can't
give
all
of
that
to
you.
If
this
book
gives
you
the
confidence
to
strike
out
on
your
own
�
that�s
great.
But
do
it
responsibly,
and
realize
that
failure
is
a
very
real
possibility
that
you
must
plan
for.
Don't
blame
me
for
the
decisions
you
make;
they
are
ultimately
your
own.
Now,
on
with
the
adventure.


PREFACE
Three
years
ago,
I
worked
for
a
big
company.
I
did
everything
a
good
American
employee
is
supposed
to
do.
I
worked
hard.
I
devoted
all
of
my
thoughts
to
making
this
big
company
even
more
successful.
I
commuted
an
hour
each
way,
without
complaint.
I
worked
50
hours
every
week
at
a
minimum.
And
when
I
got
home,
I
let
them
page
me
at
2
AM
if
something
needed
my
attention
�
which
happened
pretty
often.
Over
the
years,
I
was
rewarded
with
more
responsibility,
and
more
money
�
although
it
never
seemed
to
be
quite
enough.
I
was
considered
a
role-model
software
development
manager,
and
I
felt
successful.
At
home
however,
my
marriage
was
under
stress,
my
kids
hardly
knew
me,
and
I
was
on
prescription
sleep
aids
in
order
to
combat
the
extreme
stress
I
was
under.
My
family
wasn't
happy
living
in
the
part
of
the
country
we
lived
in,
and
they
weren't
happy
with
me.
But,
all
that
felt
secondary
to
my
duty
to
my
employer,
and
my
duty
as
a
provider
for
my
family.
I
was
doing
what
I
thought
I
had
to
do.
Three
years
ago,
I
was
faced
with
an
ultimatum
from
my
family
�
it
was
my
job,
or
them.
A
few
weeks
later,
I
quit
my
job.
I
walked
away
from
about
a
million
dollars�
worth
of
stock
grants
in
doing
so,
and
I
wasn't
happy
about
it.
But,
I
made
the
decision
to
try
working
for
myself
before
seeking
another
traditional
job.
Today,
I
run
my
own
software
company
out
of
my
home.
I
have
no
employees
to
worry
about,
and
a
revenue
stream
that
matches
anything
I
ever
made
as
a
successful
senior
manager
at
a
big
tech
company.
I
now
live
someplace
with
a
lower
cost
of
living,
I
don't
eat
out
as
much,
and
I
have
no
commuting
costs
to
deal
with�

so
I
get
to
keep
much
more
of
that
money.

My
entire
family
is
happy,
and
we're
closer
than
we've
ever
been.
I
don't
worry
about
money
anymore.
I
don't
worry
about
my
career
growth,
or
about
saying
the
wrong
thing
to
some
executive.
I
have
no
commute
and
no
meetings.
I
don't
have
to
be
in
the
office
at
9
AM,
nor
have
any
artificial
requirement
to
work
a
set
number
of
hours
each
day,
or
each
week.
I
don't
write
or
receive
performance
reviews.
I
never
have
to
fire
anyone.
Nobody
can
fire
me,
and
nobody
can
lay
me
off.
I
don't
take
sleep
aids
any
longer,
because
my
stress
level
is
basically
zero.
I'm
43
years
old,
and
I'm
pretty
sure
this
is
what
retirement
is
supposed
to
feel
like
�

except
I'm
not
too
old
to
enjoy
it,
and
I'm
not
broke.
I'm
not
telling
you
this
to
gloat.
I'm
telling
you
this
because
maybe
you're
like
I
was
three
years
ago.
Maybe
some
part
of
you
knows
that
your
only
reward
for
your
hard
work
is
going
to
be
a
heart
attack
in
a
few
years,
but
you
feel
trapped
by
your
salary
and
your
responsibilities.
You've
accepted
society's
expectations
of
focusing
entirely
on
your
work
until
you're
65
or
so,
at
which
point
you
hope
you'll
have
enough
money
saved
to
actually
retire,
and
enough
health
left
to
enjoy
it.
I'm
here
to
tell
you
there
is
another
path.
Taking
it
isn't
easy,
but
success
means
personal
and
financial
freedom
that
you
never
knew
was
possible.
This
book
tells
you
how
I
did
it,
while
minimizing
the
risks
to
my
family
in
the
process.
It
shares
what
I've
learned
along
the
way.
You
don't
have
to
be
rich
to
do
this,
and
you
don't
need
to
be
a
software
developer.
But
if
you
have
the
smarts
and
tenacity
to
be
self-sufficient,
read
on
�
it
may
just
save
your
life,
in
more
ways
than
one.


PART
I:
MAKING
THE
BIG
DECISION



OVERCOMING
INERTIA
The
first
step
toward
self-employment
is
to
want
it.
If
you've
spent
your
entire
professional
life
working
for
someone
else,
self-employment
is
a
very
scary
proposition.
The
life
you
have
is
familiar
and
comfortable,
and
the
easiest
thing
is
to
just
continue
along
your
current
career
path.
Discarding
that
career
and
striking
out
on
your
own
is
a
bold
thing
to
do.
Your
psyche
is
going
to
rebel
against
a
change
of
this
magnitude,
and
find
ways
to
justify
not
trying
it.
It's
therefore
not
surprising
that
many
self-employed
individuals
were
forced
into
their
situation.
The
ones
that
become
successful
on
their
own
talk
a
lot
about
the
personal
freedom
they
enjoy
as
a
result,
but
seeking
personal
freedom
is
not
what
motivated
them
to
achieve
it.
According
to
the
2012
Freelance
Industry
Report,
29%
of
freelancers
fell
into
their
self-employment
by
necessity,
after
being
laid
off
or
downsized.
It's
better
to
transition
into
self-employment
on
your
own
terms.
If
you
start
planning
and
set
up
your
new
business
before
you
quit
your
day
job,
you
can
ensure
you
have
income
flowing
from
the
first
day
you
start
working
for
yourself.
This
book
will
arm
you
with
the
details
you
need
to
make
that
happen,
but
first
you
need
to
decide
if
this
is
an
effort
worth
taking.
Before
we
talk
about
how
to
become
self-employed,
I
want
you
to
understand
the
forces
working
against
you.
I
want
you
to
come
to
terms
with
them,
and
I
want
you
to
understand
the
reasons
why
it
is
worth
the
effort
to
overcome
them.
That's
what
the
first
part
of
this
book
is
about:
understanding
the
barriers
to
self-employment,
both
real
and
imagined,
and
understanding
why
self-employment
is
still
a
goal
worth
pursuing.
When
we're
done,
we'll
do
a
self-assessment
to
see
if
you're
really
in
a
position
to
take
the
leap
into
self-employment.
FEAR
OF
FAILURE
Your
paycheck
puts
food
on
the
table
and
a
roof
over
your
head
pretty
reliably.
The
idea
of
giving
that
up
quickly
brings
up
images
of
your
family
starving
and
your
house
getting
foreclosed.
This
is
a
real
risk,
but
with
proper
planning
and
educated
decision
making,
it�s
a
risk
you
can
minimize.
If
you
have
responsibilities
at
home,
you
should
not
quit
your
day
job
until:
*
You've
got
a
financial
safety
net
in
place,
and
hard
and
fast
rules
as
to
how
low
you're
willing
to
let
those
reserves
get
before
returning
to
the
workplace
*
You
have
a
plan
for
getting
another
job
if
you
need
it
*
You've
already
prototyped
your
business
on
the
side
and
proven
it
is
viable
So,
you're
going
into
this
with
an
upper
bound
on
what
you're
willing
to
lose
before
calling
it
quits.
Worst
case,
you
learned
a
few
things
along
the
way.
But
just
how
risky
is
entrepreneurship?
According
to
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics
(BLS)
and
the
US
Small
Business
Administration
(SBA),
50%
of
all
new
businesses
survive
at
least
five
years.
A
third
of
new
businesses
survive
ten
years
or
more.
Now,
think
about
how
long
you
expect
your
current
job
to
last.
Would
you
say
there's
more
than
a
50%
chance
your
employer
will
still
be
around
five
years
from
now,
and
you'll
still
be
working
for
that
same
company?
The
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics
has
that
answer
as
well.
The
average
job
tenure
in
the
US
in
2012
was
only
4.6
years.
Does
starting
your
own
business
seem
that
risky
now?
Here's
another
statistic
�
the
2012
Freelance
Industry
Report
shows
that
only
22%
of
freelancers
feel
less
financially
secure
than
when
they
were
an
employee.
28%
"strongly
agree"
they
are
better
off
financially
working
for
themselves,
and
29%
"moderately
agree."
Freelancers
don't
represent
all
of
the
self-employed,
but
it's
always
an
option
for
you.
22
million
Americans
were
self-employed
in
2010,
representing
14%
of
the
workforce.
It's
not
a
fringe
thing
to
do.
They
range
from
housekeepers,
to
construction
workers,
to
web
developers,
to
doctors.
You
don't
need
a
fancy
education
and
lots
of
professional
connections
to
make
this
work
�
but
if
you
have
them,
think
of
the
advantage
you'll
have
over
the
millions
who
managed
to
make
it
work
without
them.
You
don't
need
a
full
time
employer
to
earn
a
living.
CAREER
INDOCTRINATION
So,
why
do
you
spend
most
of
your
waking
hours
working
as
hard
as
possible
to
make
somebody
else
richer?
Well,
being
raised
your
entire
life
to
believe
that
is
a
worthy
goal
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it.
We'll
talk
about
external
barriers
to
self-employment
later,
but
the
biggest
barrier
is
probably
internal
�
you
believe
self-employment
is
just
not
what
you're
supposed
to
do!
Indoctrination
is
a
strong
word,
usually
reserved
for
religious
cults
and
brainwashing.
But,
it
just
means
being
taught
a
set
of
beliefs
without
questioning
them.
Just
how
much
do
you
question
the
idea
that
you
must
have
a
job
in
order
to
be
a
responsible
member
of
society?
One
common
means
of
indoctrination
is
to
instill
ideas
into
youth
before
they
are
old
enough
to
question
them,
and
have
the
ideas
come
from
people
in
authority.
That�s
precisely
what
happened
as
you
grew
up,
pushed
along
a
track
into
a
corporate
job.
When
you
were
in
school,
you
were
probably
told
by
your
parents
and
teachers
to
get
good
grades
so
you
could
get
into
college.
In
college,
you
were
told
to
work
hard
so
you
would
get
a
job
after
you
graduated.
And
if
you
were
lucky
enough
to
get
that
job,
you
were
absorbed
into
training
and
a
culture
that
promotes
loyalty
to
your
employer.
It�s
the
end
result
of
a
lifestyle
choice
that
was
indoctrinated
into
you
at
an
early
age.
Once
you
landed
in
the
professional
world,
you
worked
hard
in
order
to
get
your
next
promotion,
or
to
just
not
get
fired.
You've
been
so
busy
following
this
path,
that
you
haven't
had
time
to
even
consider
the
alternatives.
Meanwhile,
you've
probably
picked
up
some
new
responsibilities
like
children,
a
mortgage,
or
student
loan
debt
�
and
so
the
idea
of
giving
up
a
steady
paycheck
seems
terrifying,
even
if
it's
barely
enough
to
meet
your
financial
demands.
If
you've
got
bills
to
pay
and
mouths
to
feed,
having
a
job
is
just
what
you
do.
You
probably
don't
look
forward
to
going
to
work
in
the
morning
�
hardly
anyone
does.
But
you
try
to
make
the
best
of
it,
and
fulfill
the
responsibilities
life
has
thrust
upon
you
�
year
after
year.
You
hear
about
people
starting
their
own
businesses,
but
you
think
it's
just
way
too
risky
for
someone
who
has
responsibilities
beyond
buying
their
next
foam
cup
of
Ramen
noodles.
You�ve
developed
what
is
known
as
�learned
helplessness�
�
you
aren�t
happy
with
your
stressful
career,
but
you
believe
it
is
the
best
option
available
to
you.
You
may
think
you're
trapped
in
your
career,
but
you're
not.
As
with
breaking
any
indoctrination,
the
first
step
is
to
understand
how
you
got
there,
and
develop
the
desire
to
see
alternate
paths.
Striking
out
on
your
own
and
becoming
self-employed
is
one
such
path
that
can
improve
your
lifestyle,
when
done
responsibly.
THE
CARROT
ON
A
STICK
You've
worked
hard
to
get
where
you
are
in
your
career.

You
probably
believe
you're
just
one
more
promotion
away
from
a
bigger
paycheck
that
will
change
your
lifestyle.
Or
all
those
shares
of
stock
you've
been
awarded
in
your
company
are
really
going
to
pay
off
big
one
day.
Why
would
you
quit,
and
throw
all
of
that
away?
Question
the
rewards
your
career
is
promising
you,
and
compare
them
to
the
rewards
you
could
achieve
on
your
own.
If
you�re
working
hard
toward
your
next
promotion,
there
are
several
questions
you
should
ask
yourself.
Do
you
trust
your
current
manager
to
give
you
that
promotion,
and
to
give
you
a
pay
increase
commensurate
with
the
increased
responsibilities
and
stress
that
come
with
it?
Do
you
really
believe
you'll
win
out
from
all
of
the
other
people
struggling
to
get
that
same
promotion?
Are
you
that
sure
you're
better
than
all
of
your
other
co-workers,
and
have
a
better
relationship
with
your
management
than
they
do?
The
corporate
career
world
is
a
zero-sum
game
in
the
end,
no
matter
how
you
spin
it.
If
you�re
banking
on
equity
that
you
have
vesting
in
your
employer�s
company,
ask
yourself
these
questions:
Do
you
trust
the
stock
market
with
your
net
worth?
Do
you
believe
your
hard
work
impacts
your
employer's
bottom
line
to
the
degree
that
you
materially
affect
its
stock
price,
and
the
value
of
any
equity
you
have
in
the
company?
Do
you
really
believe
that
investment
bankers
will
behave
rationally,
and
reward
good
long-term
behavior
from
your
company?
Are
you
working
for
a
startup,
and
working
almost
exclusively
for
a
tiny
slice
of
the
proceeds
if
your
employer
turns
out
to
be
a
one-in-a-hundred
acquisition
success?
If
you�ve
answered
those
questions
honestly,
you�ll
see
that
the
rewards
you�re
working
toward
are
actually
a
pretty
big
gamble.
You
may
be
staying
in
your
career
out
of
risk-aversion,
but
in
reality
your
career
is
a
pretty
risky
thing,
without
high
potential
rewards.
As
hard
as
you've
worked
for
your
employer,
your
employer
has
also
worked
to
find
ways
to
keep
you
motivated
while
spending
as
little
cash
as
possible
in
the
process.
What
do
you
consider
a
good
annual
raise?
3%?
What
sort
of
pay
increase
do
you
expect
with
a
promotion?
10%?
Are
those
stock
awards
really
worth
anything,
or
do
they
have
such
a
long
vesting
schedule
that
they
only
serve
to
keep
you
around?
If
you�ve
ever
wondered
if
you�re
just
chasing
the
proverbial
carrot
on
a
stick,
there�s
a
good
chance
you
are.
If
you
don�t
get
that
promotion
or
that
big
raise,
you�ll
be
told
it�s
because
you
didn�t
work
hard
enough,
or
weren�t
smart
enough,
compared
to
your
peers.
You
might
start
doubting
your
own
abilities
and
either
work
harder
or
accept
less
for
your
work
as
a
result
�
which
is
precisely
in
your
employer�s
best
interests,
but
not
yours.
All
that
time,
however,
you
may
have
thrived
working
for
yourself.
I�m
a
case
in
point
�
my
own
corporate
career
hit
a
dead
end
when
I
had
difficulty
getting
promoted
to
a
Director-level
job,
but
today
my
company
earns
more
than
a
Director
would.
By
focusing
my
efforts
on
building
my
own
company
instead
of
the
self-promotion
and
lobbying
required
to
achieve
corporate
career
growth,
I
ended
up
both
earning
more
and
creating
more.
Let�s
quantify
that
carrot
of
yours.
Let�s
say
10%
annual
growth
in
your
income
sounds
like
a
good
year
to
you.
If
you're
running
your
own
small
company
and
it
only
grows
10%
in
a
year,
you
should
be
asking
yourself
what
you're
doing
wrong.
The
rewards
your
employer
offers
you
are
intentionally
limited
�
in
part
to
minimize
their
expense,
and
in
part
to
prevent
pay
inequities.
When
you
work
for
yourself,
there
is
no
upper
bound
to
how
much
more
money
you
can
earn
every
year.
And,
it's
entirely
under
your
control
�
you
are
not
dependent
on
a
manager
to
decide
you
are
worthy
of
that
reward.
The
market
rewards
you
based
on
the
quality
of
your
products
and
the
demand
for
them,
end
of
story.
Let
me
state
that
again,
as
it's
a
very
important
point
�
there
is
no
upper
bound
to
what
you
can
make
when
you
are
self-employed.
There's
also
no
lower
bound
(other
than
zero),
but
with
careful
planning
you
can
mitigate
that
risk
and
choose
the
lower
bound
you're
willing
to
accept.
Face
it
�
you�re
not
going
to
get
rich
working
for
someone
else,
unless
you
have
the
connections
to
get
into
the
C-suite.
You
might
think
that's
attainable,
but
the
odds
are
very
much
against
you.
You
have
much
better
odds
of
attaining
significant
wealth
working
for
yourself.
I�m
not
promising
to
make
you
a
millionaire
�
but
even
a
much
smaller
number
can
ensure
you
no
longer
worry
about
money.
More
importantly,
the
freedom
that
comes
with
self-employment
means
you�ll
have
time
to
enjoy
the
experiences
that
money
can
buy.
EGO
PROTECTION
If
you're
successful
in
your
career,
you
probably
feel
pretty
good
about
that.
Everyone
wants
to
be
liked
and
respected,
and
a
corporate
job
can
give
you
that.
You've
probably
formed
some
close
personal
bonds
to
some
of
your
co-workers
�
working
alongside
others
in
stressful
situations
has
that
effect.
It
can
be
a
hard
thing
to
give
up.
When
you
start
your
own
company
�
guess
what,
you're
now
a
CEO.
And
a
president.
And
whatever
else
you
want
to
call
yourself.
Your
friends
won't
think
less
of
you;
they'll
probably
respect
you
even
more
for
having
the
guts
to
do
it.
Yes,
you
will
lose
a
lot
of
daily
face
to
face
interaction
with
people.
But
in
this
day
and
age
of
social
media,
it's
easy
to
stay
connected
with
your
friends.
It's
been
three
years
since
I
quit
my
job
and
moved
3,000
miles
away
�
but
I
don't
think
I've
lost
a
single
friend
in
the
process.
Successful
self-employment
will
also
require
you
to
meet
new,
like-minded
people
�
and
if
that's
not
enough,
there
are
probably
multiple
Meetup
groups
you
can
join
filled
with
local
entrepreneurs,
or
people
who
share
your
other
interests.
Work
out
of
a
coffee
shop
or
shared
co-working
space
if
you
really
need
people
around
you
all
the
time;
the
cost
is
minimal.
In
your
current
career,
your
ego
is
probably
tied
to
your
accomplishments
at
work.
Think
about
your
current
goals
at
work
�
how
much
impact
do
they
really
have
on
the
world,
or
on
your
life
outside
of
work?
Think
about
how
much
better
it
would
feel
to
create
something
big
on
your
own,
that
you
can
take
full
credit
for!
YOUR
EMPLOYER
AS
A
SECURITY
BLANKET
Your
employer
probably
takes
care
of
a
lot
of
things
for
you.
They
withhold
taxes
from
your
paycheck
so
you
don't
have
to
think
about
them
much.
They
arrange
for
your
health
insurance.
They
contribute
toward
your
Social
Security
and
Medicare
taxes.
They
pay
unemployment
insurance.
They
might
contribute
toward
dental,
vision,
or
life
insurance
as
well.
Someone
else
probably
deals
with
all
the
licensing,
legal
requirements,
and
accounting
associated
with
your
employer,
so
you
can
focus
on
a
very
narrow
job.
That's
a
lot
of
stuff
you
don't
need
to
worry
about.
You've
got
enough
to
worry
about
already,
right?
When
you
work
for
yourself,
you
do
need
to
arrange
all
of
these
things
for
yourself.
And
not
only
do
you
need
to
build
a
great
product
or
service
yourself,
you
also
need
to
do
all
the
stuff
other
people
did
for
you
at
a
big
company.
You
need
to
be
a
PR
specialist,
a
marketer,
an
accountant,
a
website
developer,
a
manager,
and
a
paralegal
depending
on
the
day.
In
all
honesty,
it
can
seem
very
intimidating
at
first.
In
reality,
arranging
insurance
for
you
and
your
family
is
a
hassle,
but
it's
something
you
just
have
to
take
care
of
once
a
year.
It's
not
that
big
of
a
deal.
Maybe
you
have
a
working
spouse,
and
you
can
just
switch
to
another
company's
benefit
plan
as
a
result.
If
so,
that's
super
easy
and
the
cheapest
way
to
go
by
far.
As
for
all
the
other
hats
you
need
to
wear
when
you're
self-employed
�
the
important
thing
is
to
understand
what
you're
not
good
at,
and
hire
others
to
do
them
for
you.
Need
a
website
for
your
new
business
and
you
don't
even
know
what
CSS
is?
Find
a
contractor
to
build
it
for
you.
Similarly,
there
are
freelance
marketing
and
PR
professionals
out
there
you
can
lean
on
as
needed.
You're
going
to
need
an
accountant
and
a
lawyer
anyhow;
the
trick
is
just
to
use
them
wisely.
You
don't
have
to
go
it
alone
in
everything
�
although
the
more
you
can
learn
yourself,
the
less
you'll
need
to
spend
on
others.
Many
areas
also
have
business
incubators
funded
by
local
governments.
Unlike
venture
capital
business
incubators,
these
resources
simply
provide
help
to
local
small
businesses
in
hopes
that
they
will
grow
and
create
more
jobs
in
the
long
run.
They
often
provide
free
advice
and
free
access
to
local
experts
in
the
areas
you
need
to
run
your
business
effectively,
and
you
should
take
advantage
of
them.
Yes,
there
are
many
new
things
you'll
need
to
learn
and
take
care
of
when
you're
self-employed.
That's
part
of
what
makes
it
exciting!
And
there
is
help
all
around
you,
if
you
just
look
for
it.


WHY
IT�S
WORTH
IT
There
are
many
perceived
barriers
to
self-employment
covered
above.
They
are
real;
doing
this
is
hard.
However,
according
to
the
2012
Freelance
Industry
Report,
90%
of
freelancers
say
they
are
happier
now
than
before
they
were
self-employed.
90%.
Think
about
that
for
a
minute.
55%
say
they
would
never
even
consider
going
back
to
work
for
someone
else
again.
You
rarely
hear
about
the
potential
rewards
of
self-employment
�
let�s
talk
about
why
it's
worth
taking
this
leap.
UNLIMITED
GROWTH
POTENTIAL
If
you
understand
how
to
create
a
business
that
can
scale
independently
from
your
own
time,
then
your
business
has
unlimited
growth
potential.
Unlike
your
corporate
job,
there
is
no
upper
bound
on
your
earnings,
and
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
your
efforts
and
the
money
you
make.
Once
you
have
created
a
product
to
sell,
you
may
sell
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
to
create
an
ongoing
stream
of
revenue.
This
is
called
passive
income,
and
it�s
a
beautiful
thing.
The
more
products
you
and
your
contractors
create,
the
more
revenue
streams
you
have.
The
more
time
you
invest
in
marketing,
sales,
and
finding
new
markets,
the
more
you�ll
sell
of
the
products
you
have.
There
is
no
limit
to
the
number
of
products
or
sales
you
can
achieve.
Often,
there
is
a
disproportionate
relationship
between
your
effort
and
the
rewards.
One
year,
I
increased
my
business
by
50%
just
by
being
smarter
about
my
online
advertising.
It
took
about
a
week
of
my
time
to
achieve
that.
Could
a
week
of
effort
result
in
a
50%
pay
raise
in
your
current
job?
I
thought
not.
Another
year,
I
doubled
my
business
by
launching
a
new
product.
It
took
a
few
months
of
dedicated
effort,
but
it
effectively
gave
me
a
100%
pay
raise
that
year
�
and
it
continues
to
grow
and
sell
more
every
year.
As
long
as
I
have
new
ideas
and
new
ways
to
market
and
promote
my
products,
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
growth
will
continue
over
the
long
run.
When
you
work
for
yourself,
you
are
forced
to
look
at
every
minute
you
spend
through
the
lens
of
"how
will
this
activity
create
more
ongoing
revenue?"
If
you
devote
yourself
full
time
to
such
endeavors,
you
are
the
direct
beneficiary
of
the
business
growth
that
results.
That
growth
will
still
be
a
direct
result
of
your
hard
work,
but
that
work
scales
your
growth
at
more
than
a
1:1
ratio.
INVESTING
IN
YOURSELF,
NOT
SOMEONE
ELSE
Your
employer
presumably
pays
you
the
market
rate
for
your
time
and
skills.
They
do
this
because
the
value
you
generate
for
their
business
exceeds
what
they
are
paying
you
�
otherwise,
it
would
not
be
profitable.
The
revenue
your
time
and
effort
generates
for
your
employer
is
more
than
the
money
you
are
paid
in
return.
If
it
isn't,
then
you
should
be
worried
about
your
job
security.
The
results
of
your
labor
are
making
someone
else
amass
millions
of
dollars.
Maybe
it's
the
executives
in
your
company.
Maybe
it's
a
bunch
of
investment
bankers
on
Wall
Street
who
trade
stock
in
your
company.
But
it's
probably
not
you
�
and
you
probably
don�t
have
time
to
enjoy
whatever
portion
of
profits
they
do
share
with
you.
When
you
work
for
yourself,
you
are
the
direct
beneficiary
of
the
revenue
your
efforts
create.
The
time
you
spend
and
the
decisions
you
make
are
an
investment
in
yourself,
not
for
a
faceless
corporation.
Come
up
with
a
great
idea
that
makes
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
a
year?
That
goes
straight
to
your
own
net
worth.
Do
the
same
while
working
for
a
large
company,
and
the
most
you
can
hope
for
is
a
promotion
and
a
10%
pay
raise.
The
self-employed
are
investing
in
themselves,
instead
of
in
someone
else,
by
having
100%
of
the
fruits
of
their
labor
available
for
their
own
later
use.

If
your
business
is
growing
and
you
understand
why
and
how
to
sustain
that
growth,
investing
in
your
own
business
could
easily
yield
better
returns
than
investing
in
your
employer's
401(K)
plan,
or
your
employer's
stock.
It's
not
just
about
money,
either.
When
you
are
self-employed,
you
are
forced
to
learn
new
skills,
meet
new
people,
and
to
be
creative.
You'll
grow
personally
across
a
wide
range
of
disciplines,
like
it
or
not.
The
skills
and
bigger-picture
thinking
you
gain
is
also
an
investment
in
yourself.
NO
DEPENDENCIES
When
you
work
for
a
big
company,
it's
hard
to
accomplish
anything
alone.
You'll
probably
need
the
cooperation
of
others.
You'll
depend
on
other
teams
to
deliver
things
your
project
requires.
You'll
depend
on
management
to
remain
committed
to
your
project
and
not
de-prioritize
it
without
warning.
You'll
depend
on
your
own
teammates
to
deliver
good
work,
on
time.
There's
a
lot
that
can
happen
to
derail
your
results,
and
often
it
is
outside
of
your
control.
Few
things
are
more
frustrating
than
failing
due
to
the
actions
(or
inaction)
of
others.
It
happens
more
often
than
not;
according
to
a
study
in
20081,
68%
of
corporate
technology
projects
fail,
and
over
41%
of
engineering
time
is
spent
developing
requirements
that
proved
to
be
unnecessary.
When
you
work
for
yourself,
your
success
hinges
on
your
abilities
alone.
Perhaps
you
rely
on
contractors
to
build
parts
of
your
business,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
are
the
one
who
tells
them
what
to
do,
and
can
make
the
decision
to
replace
them
if
necessary.
If
you
hire
people,
you're
the
one
who
decided
to
hire
them.
If
they
can't
deliver
what
you
need,
it's
your
own
fault
�
but
you
at
least
you
have
the
authority
to
replace
them.
After
all,
you're
the
CEO!
Nobody
is
going
to
screw
up
what
you're
doing,
other
than
you.
"Office
politics"
will
no
longer
exist.
If
you
are
the
sort
of
person
who
relies
on
being
part
of
a
larger
team
that
you
can
lean
on,
this
might
sound
scary.
I'll
be
honest:

if
this
scares
you,
self-employment
might
not
be
for
you.
If
you're
confident
in
your
abilities
however,
this
lack
of
dependencies
sounds
like
a
very,
very
good
thing.
Your
own
ability
to
deliver
is
all
that
stands
between
you
and
your
vision.
NO
COMMUTE
An
average
20-mile
commute
ends
up
costing
you
at
least
$50,000
every
ten
years2.
The
average
car
owner
is
involved
in
an
automobile
accident
once
every
17.9
years3.
Your
lifetime
odds
of
being
killed
in
a
motor
vehicle
accident
in
the
United
States
are
a
disturbing
1:1124.
An
automobile
accident
is
by
far
the
most
likely
way
to
die
by
injury.
Your
commute
isn�t
just
draining
your
money,
time,
and
energy
�
it
could
very
well
kill
you.
When
you�re
self-employed,
it's
up
to
you
where
your
office
is.
Maybe
it's
just
down
the
hallway
from
your
bedroom.
Maybe
you
rent
a
small
office
down
the
street.
Perhaps
you
hang
out
at
the
local
coffee
shop
once
in
a
while
just
to
get
out.
But
unless
you
really
enjoy
sitting
in
rush-hour
traffic,
you
can
kiss
that
goodbye
when
you
work
for
yourself.
According
to
the
US
Census
Bureau,
the
average
American
spends
50
minutes
every
day
commuting
to
work
and
back.
Think
of
what
you
could
get
done
with
an
extra
hour
every
day
�
or
even
how
you
might
spend
that
time
relaxing
or
recharging
yourself
however
you
like.
You
might
actually
have
time
for
hobbies
�
and
not
dealing
with
traffic
is
a
huge
stress
reliever
in
itself.
It's
not
just
time
you'll
get
back,
it's
money.
If
you
work
from
home,
will
you
really
need
that
second
car?
How
much
are
you
spending
on
gas
every
week
just
to
get
to
work?
How
about
on
parking?
Or
tolls?
Maintenance
on
your
car?
Bus
fares?
Really�
go
add
it
up.
One
thing
that
amazed
me
pretty
quickly
after
becoming
self-employed
was
how
much
less
I
spent,
and
how
much
more
of
my
earnings
I
got
to
keep
as
a
result.
Eliminating
commuting
costs
was
a
big
part
of
that.
(You'll
also
eat
out
less,
which
is
a
bigger
drain
on
your
money
than
you
probably
realize,
as
well
as
a
drain
on
your
health.)
FREEDOM
TO
LIVE
WHERE
YOU
WANT
Why
do
you
live
where
you
are?
Chances
are
it's
because
it's
near
your
employer's
office.
Unfortunately,
high-tech,
high-paying
jobs
tend
to
be
concentrated
in
places
with
very
high
costs
of
living.
The
most
tech
jobs
exist
in
the
San
Jose,
California
area5,
which
also
has
a
cost
of
living
49.3%
higher
than
the
US
average6.
Even
if
you�re
making
a
six-figure
salary
in
Silicon
Valley,
a
software
engineer
in
Austin,
Texas
probably
has
quite
a
bit
more
discretionary
spending
money
than
you
do7
�
not
to
mention
less
of
a
commute.
Much
of
the
money
you�re
currently
spending
on
housing
is
wasted,
when
you
consider
you
could
live
somewhere
nicer
for
much
less
money.
This
depends
on
what
sort
of
business
you
start
for
yourself,
but
many
businesses
these
days
may
be
conducted
entirely
online.
In
fact,
this
is
a
desirable
business
model
because
it
opens
up
the
entire
world
as
your
marketplace,
instead
of
limiting
yourself
to
your
local
area.
If
you
don't
have
the
freedom
to
run
your
business
wherever
you
want,
perhaps
you're
not
running
the
right
kind
of
business.
This
is
where
lifestyle
changes
really
start
to
kick
in.
Want
to
move
to
the
tropics,
or
someplace
with
a
much
lower
cost
of
living?
You
have
no
need
to
live
in
a
big,
expensive
metropolitan
area
unless
you
want
to.
Think
of
the
money
you
could
save,
or
the
higher
standard
of
living
you
can
enjoy,
by
moving
someplace
where
houses
cost
half
of
what
they
do
in
your
area.
Now,
you
shouldn't
hang
out
a
for-sale
sign
on
your
front
lawn
just
yet
�
living
in
an
expensive
place
probably
means
you're
living
near
a
lot
of
employment
opportunities.
In
the
early
years
of
your
business,
you'll
want
to
live
close
to
potential
employers
because
going
back
to
work
is
one
of
your
backup
plans
in
case
your
business
doesn't
work
out.
If
your
current
mortgage
or
rent
is
manageable,
you
should
probably
stay
put
until
your
new
business
is
well-established.
If
your
business
reaches
the
point
where
it
is
providing
reliably
growing
income
however,
the
sky's
the
limit.
You
can
move
anywhere
that
has
an
Internet
connection,
which
is
basically
the
entire
planet
at
your
disposal.
Hawaii?
Fiji?
New
Zealand?
There's
no
need
to
dream
small
�
it�s
an
attainable
goal.
FREEDOM
TO
WORK
WHEN
YOU
WANT
A
2014
Gallup
poll8
showed
the
average
full-time
US
worker
spends
46.7
hours
at
the
office
every
week.
18%
spend
60
or
more
hours
per
week
at
work.
They
have
very
little
flexibility
in
when
those
hours
are
spent;
meetings
and
employer
expectations
dictate
getting
up
early
and
coming
home
late
for
most
workers.
Running
your
own
business
is
a
lot
of
work,
but
you
can
usually
choose
when
to
do
it.
If
you're
running
an
Internet-based
business,
you
might
have
customers
all
over
the
globe.
9
to
5
in
your
time
zone
is
a
meaningless
concept
�
it�s
always
9
AM
somewhere.
So,
you
may
as
well
work
when
it's
convenient
for
you.
I
do
my
best
work
in
the
early
morning.
Most
days,
I've
handled
all
of
my
customer
support
emails
before
I
even
drive
my
kids
to
school
in
the
morning,
freeing
up
the
rest
of
the
day
for
whatever
new
product
development
I
want
to
work
on
�

or
anything
else
that
needs
to
be
done,
be
it
business
or
personal.
No
need
to
stress
out
about
finding
room
on
your
calendar
for
that
doctor's
appointment,
or
catching
the
kids'
school
concert
or
award
presentation.
You're
the
boss,
and
the
only
meetings
you
have
are
the
ones
you
made
yourself
with
your
customers.
If
you
work
from
home,
you
won't
even
lose
travel
time
to
these
occasional
personal
responsibilities.
Want
to
work
7
to
3?
11
to
7?
Nobody's
going
to
stop
you.
The
eight-hour
work
day
is
an
arbitrary
construct
anyhow;
you
can
just
stop
working
when
you
feel
fatigued,
or
you
feel
you've
achieved
whatever
goal
you
set
for
yourself
today.
If
you're
worthless
after
lunch,
you
can
go
relax
in
the
pool
for
an
hour
and
get
back
to
work
once
your
mental
energy
level
is
back
up.
In
fact,
why
stop
there?
As
the
owner
of
your
own
business,
you
have
the
freedom
to
make
your
own
tradeoffs
between
time
and
money.
If
you've
got
enough
revenue
coming
in
to
hire
contractors
or
assistants
to
handle
much
of
what
you
do,
you
can
do
so
�
and
work
less
than
8
hours
a
day.
Tim
Ferriss's
book
"The
Four
Hour
Work
Week"
goes
into
a
lot
of
depth
on
this
strategy.
If
you're
smart
about
the
kind
of
business
you
create,
the
title
of
that
book
actually
is
not
hyperbole.
I
really
could
sustain
my
business
with
about
4
hours
of
work
a
week,
just
handling
customer
inquiries
batched
up
into
an
hour
or
less
per
day,
and
directing
the
work
of
contractors.
When
I
go
on
vacations
with
my
family,
that's
exactly
what
I
do.
However,
I
still
work
at
least
40
hours
a
week
when
I'm
not
on
vacation,
because
I'm
always
trying
out
new
things
to
ensure
my
business
continues
to
grow.
As
with
most
things
in
life,
you
get
what
you
put
into
it
�
and
having
a
strong
work
ethic
will
pay
dividends.
"Flexibility
in
work
schedule"
was
the
top-rated
benefit
of
self-employment
in
the
2012
Freelance
Industry
Report.
You
might
be
surprised
to
hear
that
46%
of
respondents
say
they
had
more
free
time
after
working
for
themselves;
there
is
a
myth
that
the
self-employed
must
work
extra-hard
in
order
to
make
ends
meet,
but
in
fact
the
opposite
is
often
true.
With
great
freedom
comes
great
responsibility,
however.
Although
it
might
be
tempting
to
take
a
3-hour
lunch
break
because
you
can,
you
must
have
the
self-discipline
to
realize
how
much
your
time
is
worth
as
a
business
owner,
and
use
it
wisely.
Had
you
spent
those
3
hours
on
sales
or
marketing
instead,
you�d
probably
be
a
little
bit
richer.
But,
that�s
your
own
decision
to
make.
FREEDOM
TO
WORK
HOW
YOU
WANT
According
to
the
American
Psychological
Association,
most
stress
on
the
job
arises
from
a
sense
of
powerlessness.
You
are
always
doing
what
you�re
told,
to
someone
else�s
specifications
and
on
someone
else�s
timeframe.
�A
feeling
of
powerlessness
is
a
universal
cause
of
job
stress.
When
you
feel
powerless,
you're
prey
to
depression's
traveling
companions,
helplessness
and
hopelessness.
You
don't
alter
or
avoid
the
situation
because
you
feel
nothing
can
be
done.�9
It�s
a
huge
problem
�
according
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control10,
40%
of
workers
describe
their
job
as
�very
or
extremely
stressful,�
and
this
job
stress
is
more
strongly
associated
with
health
complaints
than
financial
or
family
problems.
If
you
work
in
a
creative
field,
you
will
probably
welcome
the
complete
creative
freedom
you
have
as
a
self-employed
individual.
There
are
no
top-down
restrictions
on
what
you
make,
other
than
those
from
your
clients.
If
you're
a
computer
programmer,
you
won't
have
to
conform
to
some
external
style
guide
or
some
existing
architecture
�
you
can
create
your
own.
If
you're
an
artist,
your
own
personal
style
can
show
through
to
your
work.
Working
without
these
restrictions
can
let
you
focus
on
what's
important.
Did
I
mention
the
lack
of
dress
code
when
you
work
for
yourself?
If
you're
not
meeting
face
to
face
with
clients,
you
can
wear
whatever
you
want.
No
need
to
maintain
an
expensive
wardrobe.
Personally,
I
try
to
look
professional
on
work
days
regardless;
it
helps
to
keep
me
in
the
right
frame
of
mind.


IS
SELF-EMPLOYMENT
FOR
YOU?
Self-employment
offers
many
forms
of
freedom
that
you
simply
cannot
have
in
a
corporate
environment.
It
gives
you
a
path
to
unbounded
growth
and
rewards,
limited
only
by
your
own
skills,
talents,
and
time.
If
this
all
sounds
good
so
far,
it's
time
to
get
serious.
Let's
decide
if
self-employment
is
a
path
you
want
to
try
out.
Is
it
for
you?
That's
a
very
important
question
to
answer.
There
are
real
risks
to
starting
your
own
business,
and
you
need
to
honestly
assess
your
situation
and
your
own
skills
before
diving
in.
You
need
to
understand
the
risks
you're
undertaking,
and
your
personal
likelihood
of
success.
Even
then,
there
are
no
guarantees
�
but
going
through
the
exercises
in
this
chapter
should
at
least
give
you
a
better
idea
of
where
you
stand.
It
can
all
end
unimaginably
well,
but
it
can
also
end
badly.
We
want
to
make
sure
the
odds
are
in
your
favor
�
if
not,
perhaps
you
should
spend
some
more
time
in
the
conventional
workforce
building
up
more
savings
and
developing
more
skills.
Self-employment
may
be
for
you,
but
just
not
now.
FLOWCHART:
SHOULD
I
EVEN
CONSIDER
SELF-EMPLOYMENT?
There
is
risk
involved
with
self-employment.
Minimizing
that
risk
means
ensuring
you
have
a
financial
cushion
in
place,
as
well
as
a
plan
for
dealing
with
health
care
expenses.
If
you're
going
to
put
yourself
in
a
position
where
you
are
truly
betting
the
farm
by
quitting
your
job,
we
need
to
identify
that
right
now,
and
you
need
to
store
this
book
until
your
situation
changes.
Here's
a
flowchart
that
will
at
least
tell
you
if
you're
taking
a
crazy
risk
by
even
thinking
about
this.

If
you're
reading
this
on
a
device
that
can't
display
this
flowchart
well,
I'll
describe
its
main
points:
HAVING
A
FINANCIAL
SAFETY
NET
Assuming
you've
done
the
initial
legwork
and
product
development
for
your
new
business
before
quitting
your
day
job,
we're
going
to
say
you'll
need
at
least
3
months
to
figure
out
if
you
can
really
earn
a
living
from
it
�

and
if
not,
another
month
to
find
a
new
job
instead.
You
may
want
to
increase
or
decrease
that
estimate,
depending
on
the
employment
market
for
people
with
your
particular
skills
and
experience.
If
you�re
burning
up
the
last
months�
worth
of
your
reserves,
the
following
month
needs
to
show
more
income
from
your
business
than
your
monthly
expenses
add
up
to.
If
not,
then
it�s
time
to
go
back
to
work
and
try
again
later.

That
means
you'll
need
at
least
4
months
of
living
expenses
saved
up,
just
in
case
your
big
idea
turns
out
to
be
a
complete
bust.
A
few
months
doesn�t
sound
like
enough
time
to
prove
a
business
is
viable,
but
we
will
be
doing
a
lot
of
testing
before
you
quit
your
day
job.
In
reality
you
have
as
much
time
as
you
need,
if
you
factor
in
the
time
you
spend
developing
your
business
on
the
side.
If
you're
lucky,
you
have
a
supportive
spouse
or
parents
who
can
pay
the
bills
during
this
time.
If
you're
not
so
lucky,
you
need
to
save
this
money
up
first.
And
I'm
talking
about
cash
savings
here
�
money
you
can
easily
withdraw
if
needed,
without
penalties.
How
much
cash
are
we
talking
about?
Don't
make
the
mistake
of
adding
up
your
basic
living
expenses
such
as
rent,
your
cell
phone
bill,
etc.
You
probably
spend
a
lot
more
every
month
than
you
realize,
and
no
matter
how
much
you
tell
yourself
you
can
just
tighten
your
belt
and
spend
less
for
a
while,
in
reality
that's
much
harder
to
do
than
you
think.
Instead,
go
get
your
last
6
months
of
bank
statements,
and
figure
out
how
much
you
actually
spend
on
average
every
month.
Multiply
that
number
by
4,
and
that's
what
you
need
sitting
in
your
savings
account.
If
you
have
any
large
expenses
looming
ahead
of
you,
like
tax
payments,
be
sure
to
factor
that
in
as
well.
If
you
don't
have
that
much
money
in
your
bank
account
today,
think
about
if
you
will
in
the
near
future.
Do
you
have
a
bonus
coming
up?
Stock
grants
that
are
vesting?
A
big
tax
refund?
Something
you
can
sell
that
you
don't
want
any
longer?
Those
are
good
ways
to
fund
your
endeavor.
You
might
also
consider
doing
some
freelance
or
contract
work
to
help
pay
the
bills
while
your
business
spins
up.
This
is
a
great
idea,
but
I
wouldn't
rely
on
that
revenue.
It's
all
too
common
for
contracts
to
go
bad,
and
to
have
trouble
collecting
on
your
invoices
in
a
timely
manner.
It's
also
a
little
too
tempting
to
lean
on
freelance
revenue,
instead
of
investing
your
time
into
building
a
business
that
can
grow
beyond
the
number
of
billable
hours
you
can
work
each
month.
Do
NOT
take
out
a
loan
to
do
this,
from
anyone.
There
is
a
very
real
possibility
that
your
endeavor
will
fail,
and
you
don't
want
to
be
saddled
with
debt
after
you've
already
depleted
your
savings.
Don't
take
a
loan
from
Uncle
Bob,
don't
take
out
a
home
equity
loan,
and
don�t
bet
your
kids'
college
fund
or
your
retirement
fund.
And
for
God's
sake,
don't
plan
to
just
max
out
your
credit
cards.
Just
don't.
If
you
don't
have
the
cash
to
do
this
responsibly,
put
this
book
away
until
you
do.
Remember
about
50%
of
new
business
fail,
and
that�s
a
very
real
possibility
you
must
plan
for.
Even
if
your
business
succeeds,
you�ll
be
paying
interest
on
that
loan
that
you
could
have
avoided
by
building
up
your
business
with
your
own
money
over
time,
on
the
side.

If
you're
reading
this
book
because
you
lost
your
job
and
you
don't
have
the
savings
or
severance
package
you
need
to
try
self-employment,
focus
your
efforts
on
finding
a
new
job
instead.
I
mean
that.
PLANNING
FOR
HEALTH
CARE
If
you
live
in
a
country
with
universal
health
care
coverage,
then
you
probably
don't
need
to
worry
about
this
too
much.
For
our
readers
in
the
United
States
however,
health
insurance
is
now
a
very
big
problem
for
the
self-employed
�
and
it's
something
you
need
to
consider
before
deciding
to
take
the
leap.
The
laws
surrounding
this
are
changing
every
year,
so
it's
a
good
idea
to
do
some
research
of
your
own.
As
of
this
writing
in
2015,
health
care
expenses
for
the
successfully
self-employed
in
the
United
States
are
extremely
high.
I�m
not
making
a
political
statement,
but
the
fact
is
my
own
self-employment
health
insurance
premiums
doubled
with
the
passage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(�Obamacare�,)
and
I
was
left
with
worse
coverage
than
I
had
before
as
well.
Perhaps
by
the
time
you�ve
read
this,
subsidies
for
small
business
owners
will
exist,
so
it�s
worth
checking
if
the
system
has
since
been
improved
to
be
friendlier
to
the
self-employed.
As
of
now
however,
your
best
option
is
to
add
yourself
as
a
dependent
on
an
employer-provided
health
plan
offered
to
your
spouse
or
parents.

If
their
employer
subsidizes
health
care
at
all,
then
it
will
certainly
be
a
much
cheaper
option
than
purchasing
your
own
health
insurance
�
not
to
mention
far
less
complicated.

Ask
them
to
find
out
what
it
would
cost
to
add
you
to
their
plan,
and
figure
that
into
your
planned
monthly
expenses.
We
can
just
move
on.
If
you
will
need
to
provide
your
own
health
insurance,
keep
reading.
How
do
you
figure
out
if
you
have
enough
savings
to
provide
your
own
health
insurance?
If
you
won't
be
covered
by
someone
else's
insurance
and
you
live
in
the
U.S.,
visit
www.healthcare.gov.
It's
pretty
easy
to
find
out
what
sorts
of
plans
will
be
available
to
you
once
you
are
self-employed,
and
what
they
cost.
The
cost
will
vary
depending
on
your
income,
so
to
be
conservative
assume
your
business
will
be
successful
and
you
will
not
receive
any
government
subsidies
to
offset
the
premium
costs.
Done?
I
bet
you've
got
a
good
case
of
sticker
shock
now.
Depending
on
your
age
and
the
size
of
your
family,
you're
probably
looking
at
monthly
premiums
on
the
order
of
$1,000
per
month
for
a
plan
that
won't
pay
for
anything
until
you've
paid
about
$10,000
or
more
out-of-pocket
for
health
care
expenses.
Don't
bother
being
angry
about
it.
There's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it,
and
you
are
required
by
law
to
have
this
coverage.

You
just
have
to
plan
for
it.
We
also
need
to
think
about
that
pesky
deductible.

Let's
say
you
do
have
a
$10,000
deductible.
If
you're
in
good
health,
you
can
take
a
risk
and
bet
that
you
won't
incur
any
health
care
expenses
while
you're
testing
out
your
business
in
its
first
few
months.
But
the
prudent
thing
is
to
assume
something
will
go
horribly
wrong,
and
you'll
somehow
find
yourself
with
a
$10,000
medical
bill
during
this
time.

One
trip
to
the
hospital
is
all
it
takes.
You
really
should
have
the
amount
of
your
deductible
saved
up
somewhere,
in
addition
to
your
4
months
of
living
expenses.
Otherwise,
you're
taking
a
big
gamble.
You
now
have
some
numbers
to
factor
into
your
planned
savings�
budget
for
health
care.
Do
you
still
have
enough
saved
up
to
cover
your
expenses
for
the
first
few
months,
with
those
health
care
costs
factored
in?
If
so,
great�we
can
move
on.
If
not,
you
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
save
more,
and
revisit
this
book
once
you
have
the
necessary
reserves.


SELF-ASSESSMENT
QUIZ
If
you've
gotten
this
far,
you've
got
the
financial
safety
net
and
health
care
planning
you
need
to
try
out
self-employment.
But
just
because
you
can
try
self-employment
doesn't
mean
you
should.
There
is
nothing
scientific
about
the
following
self-assessment
quiz;
it
is
merely
a
collection
of
qualities
I've
found
to
be
essential
during
my
own
self-employment.
The
more
you
have,
the
better.
But
if
you
only
have
a
few,
self-employment
may
not
be
for
you.
Be
honest,
now!
Quiz:
Do
I
Have
the
Qualities
for
Successful
Self-Employment?
Just
count
up
the
number
of
positive
responses
to
the
following
questions.
___
I
was
successful
in
my
chosen
career
due
to
my
ability
to
consistently
deliver
results
in
a
timely
manner.
___
I'm
at
my
most
productive
when
working
alone,
without
a
large
team
to
back
me
up.
___
I
can
think
of
several
examples
where
I
successfully
taught
myself
a
new
skill
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
___
I
don't
leave
projects
half-finished;
I
always
put
in
the
effort
required
to
finish
them.
An
unfinished
product
has
zero
value!
___
I
am
consistently
responsive
to
people
who
contact
me.
I
don't
just
ignore
emails
and
voice-mails.
___
I
manage
my
time
well,
and
rarely
feel
overwhelmed
as
a
result.
___
I
am
good
at
focusing
on
the
task
at
hand
and
tuning
out
distractions.
___
I've
been
told
that
I
have
good
communication
skills.
___
I
have
at
least
100
professional
connections
in
my
social
networks.
___
I
have
the
self-discipline
to
work
hard
without
a
boss
monitoring
me.
What's
your
score?
8-10:
You
possess
the
personal
qualities
required
to
pull
this
off.
Look
at
the
one
or
two
items
you
didn't
check
off
however
�
they
are
still
important,
and
you
should
think
about
how
you
can
either
augment
these
skills,
or
contract
someone
else
to
help
you
out
with
them.
6-8:
Self-employment
will
not
come
easily
to
you,
but
the
necessity
of
putting
food
on
the
table
will
probably
motivate
you
to
overcome
the
qualities
you're
missing
in
the
end.
As
before,
finding
ways
to
address
the
personal
qualities
you're
missing
either
through
training
or
purchasing
the
services
of
others
will
be
important.
0-5:
I'm
not
so
sure
self-employment
is
the
best
choice
for
you,
but
you're
not
so
different
from
most
people
who
are
self-employed.
The
thing
is,
most
self-employed
people
are
just
getting
by,
earning
on
average
about
$40,000
per
year
working
as
independent
housekeepers,
child-care
workers,
construction
workers,
and
the
like
(Census
data,
aggregated
QuickBooks
data,
and
BLS
data
agree
on
that
number).
If
you
want
your
business
to
be
a
runaway
success,
you
should
consider
partnering
with
someone
who
possesses
the
qualities
you
lack,
and
whom
you
can
implicitly
trust
�
but
only
once
you're
in
a
financial
position
to
share
your
revenue
with
a
partner.
You
can
see
the
Catch-22
there.
You
may
be
better
off
working
for
someone
else,
unless
$40,000
per
year
is
more
than
you're
earning
now.
Keep
in
mind
there
is
no
guarantee
you
will
earn
that
much,
or
anything
for
that
matter.
At
this
point,
we've
determined
whether
you
are
in
a
position
to
try
self-employment,
and
a
rough
idea
of
your
outlook
for
success.
What's
your
decision?
Try
going
it
on
your
own,
or
continue
to
focus
on
your
career?
There's
no
wrong
answer;
self-employment
is
not
for
everyone.
But
if
you
are
going
to
try
self-employment
�
you
are
about
to
embark
on
an
adventure
you'll
never
forget.
I
want
it
to
end
well,
and
the
next
two
parts
of
this
book
will
tell
you
all
I
know
about
making
that
happen.


PART
II:
MAKING
IT
HAPPEN




DESIGNING
A
BUSINESS
FOR
YOUR
LIFESTYLE
Maybe
you
already
have
an
idea
of
what
you'll
do
when
you
are
self-employed.
But,
the
obvious
choice
isn't
always
the
right
one.
This
section
will
help
you
plan
for
the
long
term,
maximize
your
lifestyle
benefits,
and
build
a
business
that
can
grow
independently
from
your
time.
You
don't
have
to
get
your
business
idea
right
the
first
time;
what
you
do
will
and
should
evolve
over
time,
as
your
customers
and
the
marketplace
changes.
Ultimately
you'll
want
to
offer
a
wide
variety
of
products
and
services
in
order
to
diversify
your
offerings
and
make
your
income
more
reliable.
In
the
short
term,
all
that's
important
is
finding
a
way
to
pay
the
bills
without
a
paycheck.
You'll
learn
as
you
go.
Get
one
of
those
Moleskine
notebooks,
and
keep
notes
of
all
the
information,
advice,
ideas,
and
learnings
you
acquire
along
the
way.
Revisiting
those
thoughts
later
will
help
you
continually
refine
your
business
and
find
new
business
ideas
to
try
out.
You
need
to
start
with
something,
however.
Many
will
rely
on
freelance
work
during
this
initial
period,
but
freelance
work
does
not
realize
the
full
potential
of
freedom
and
lifestyle
self-employment
can
offer.

As
a
freelancer,
time
really
is
money.
Your
growth
potential
is
limited
by
the
number
of
billable
hours
you
can
work
in
a
week.
You're
still
working
for
other
people
�
your
clients
�
and
developing
things
according
to
their
specifications.
They
might
even
demand
that
you
work
on-site.
In
many
cases,
you're
just
working
as
a
contractor
so
your
clients
can
avoid
the
expenses
of
providing
benefits
to
you
and
employing
you
over
a
longer
period
of
time.
As
mentioned
earlier,
90%
of
freelancers
do
believe
their
lifestyle
is
better
than
traditional
employment
�
but
you
can
do
even
better.
You
should
have
another
revenue
stream
gestating
that
can
take
its
place
over
time.
As
a
freelancer,
your
clients
have
no
expectation
that
you
only
work
on
their
tasks.
You
are
free
to
pursue
your
long-term
objectives
at
the
same
time.
We're
going
to
explore
what
kind
of
objective
you
should
have
in
mind.
THE
FALLACY
OF
THE
GROWTH
BUSINESS
When
you
hear
about
entrepreneurs
and
people
starting
their
own
business,
the
press
tends
to
focus
on
what
is
known
as
"growth
businesses."
These
are
the
startups
you
hear
about
in
Silicon
Valley,
or
the
small
businesses
you
see
on
TV
on
"Shark
Tank."
They
seek
large
amounts
of
investment
at
an
early
stage,
amass
large
amounts
of
debt,
and
attempt
to
grow
their
business
as
quickly
as
possible
to
create
a
revenue
stream
that
offsets
that
initial
investment.
Their
ultimate
goal
is
usually
to
sell
the
company
to
a
larger
company,
and
get
rich
in
the
process
through
whatever
personal
stake
they
may
still
have
in
it.
At
that
point,
the
investors
get
rich
as
well.
The
problem
is:
it
very
rarely
works
out
that
way
in
the
end.
93%
of
companies
started
by
the
much-touted
"Y
Combinator"
business
accelerator
in
Silicon
Valley
ultimately
fail,
according
to
a
2013
article
from
Business
Insider11.
This
is
consistent
with
the
common
wisdom
that
only
one
out
of
ten
startups
succeeds.
Venture
capitalists
invest
in
a
wide
range
of
companies
with
the
expectation
that
most
will
fail,
but
the
rare
one
that
succeeds
will
offset
those
losses
for
them.
Even
of
the
startups
that
are
sold
to
a
larger
company
in
the
end,
most
are
what
are
considered
"acqui-hires."
The
startup
actually
failed
to
create
a
sustainable
revenue
stream,
and
is
only
being
acquired
as
a
way
to
hire
a
bunch
of
talented
people
at
once.
Usually
the
only
real
reward
to
the
founder
in
this
case
is
that
they
have
a
traditional
job
again.
If
your
ultimate
goal
is
to
become
a
project
manager
at
Apple,
then
that's
great.
But
that's
not
what
this
book
is
about.
If
you're
at
a
point
in
your
life
where
you
have
the
ability
to
live
on
a
shoestring
for
years
in
exchange
for
a
10%
chance
at
riches,
AND
you
have
an
idea
awesome
enough
to
attract
significant
venture
capital,
well,
I
can't
stop
you.
If
you
think
you
can
found
the
next
Oculus
or
WhatsApp
that
gets
acquired
for
an
outrageous
sum
of
money,
and
you
can
accept
working
ridiculously
hard
for
very
little
money
for
years
for
the
slim
chance
of
that
happening,
go
for
it.
I
should
also
point
out
that
unless
you
live
in
Silicon
Valley
or
New
York,
and
are
a
20-something
male,
the
odds
are
even
further
against
you.

(See
"The
Brutal
Ageism
of
Tech",
New
Republic,
"Why
Women
Should
Get
The
Hell
Out
of
Ageist,
Sexist
Companies",
Inc.,
or
any
of
the
other
212,000
results
you'll
get
when
searching
for
"ageism
and
sexism
in
Silicon
Valley".)
Venture
capitalists
want
young,
energetic
founders
who
will
happily
work
for
next
to
nothing
�
and
they
seem
to
like
founders
that
remind
them
of
themselves
in
college.
It's
not
fair,
but
that's
the
world
we
live
in.
I�m
hopeful
that
the
sexism
in
venture
capital
will
subside
as
more
attention
is
drawn
to
it,
but
ageism
seems
likely
to
persist.
If
your
business
isn't
tech-related
to
begin
with,
you're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
finding
venture
capital
at
all.
There
are
funds
that
don't
focus
exclusively
on
tech,
or
focus
on
women
or
minority-owned
businesses,
but
they
are
the
exception.
However,
there
is
a
much
less
risky
path
�
one
where
you
get
to
keep
your
free
time,
your
money,
and
your
freedom.
You'll
have
a
lower
chance
of
becoming
a
billionaire,
but
you
have
a
higher
chance
of
living
a
rich
lifestyle.
INTRODUCING
THE
LIFESTYLE
BUSINESS
The
astute
may
say,
"Only
one
in
ten
startups
survive?
Didn't
you
say
earlier
in
this
book
that
half
of
all
new
businesses
last
five
years
or
more?"
I
did.
Both
statements
are
true
�
but
most
businesses
are
not
startup
"growth
businesses."
They
are
lifestyle
businesses.
A
startup
business
is
designed
to
grow
fast,
above
all
else.
In
contrast,
a
lifestyle
business
exists
for
the
sole
purpose
of
providing
revenue
and
freedom
to
you
and
your
family
over
the
long
run.
All
those
family-owned
restaurants,
barber
shops,
pool
cleaners,
landscapers,
roofing
companies,
freelancers,
and
people
selling
crafts
or
imported
goods
online
are
running
a
lifestyle
business.
Their
objective
is
not
to
grow
into
a
company
that
employs
thousands
of
people,
or
to
get
acquired
by
Google
for
billions
of
dollars.
Their
goal
is
to
simply
do
what
they
love
to
do
on
their
own
terms,
and
earn
enough
money
doing
it
such
that
they
can
enjoy
life
and
some
freedom.
You
rarely
hear
about
how
these
companies
come
to
be,
but
you're
surrounded
by
them
all
the
time.
This
is
a
much
more
attainable
goal.
You
don't
need
to
be
a
landscaper
or
a
restaurateur
to
do
it;
there
are
even
better
options
�
ones
that
don't
involve
the
responsibility
of
hiring
and
managing
others,
or
being
tied
to
a
single
physical
location.
PLANNING
THE
IDEAL
LIFESTYLE
BUSINESS
When
planning
for
a
new
lifestyle
business,
we
want
to
maximize
all
of
the
benefits
of
self-employment
we
discussed
earlier.
Your
business
should
be
designed
to
do
so
from
the
start.
Let's
review
those
benefits,
and
how
your
business
can
realize
them
to
their
fullest.
Unlimited
growth
potential.
Your
business
should
create
products
that
can
create
an
ongoing
revenue
stream
with
minimal
further
investment
of
your
own
time.
Your
time
is
limited,
and
a
business
that
can
only
grow
with
the
time
you
put
into
it
cannot
scale.
A
freelancer's
business
cannot
scale
beyond
that
freelancer's
available
time;
but
building
a
marketplace
for
freelancers
can.
The
ideal
situation
is
to
create
digital
products
with
some
time
up
front,
which
can
then
sell
themselves
indefinitely
through
online
purchasing
and
distribution,
completely
automatically.
Even
your
marketing
can
be
largely
automated
through
targeted
online
ads
and
building
a
website
optimized
for
conversions.
Physical
products
can
work
the
same
way,
if
you
can
outsource
the
production
and
distribution
of
your
product
at
a
reasonable
cost.
Investing
in
yourself,
not
someone
else.
You
want
to
avoid
the
need
to
take
on
investors
or
debt
in
order
to
start
your
business.
Instead,
create
a
business
you
may
bootstrap
using
the
time
and
money
you
have
available
while
you're
still
employed.
Investors
generally
are
not
interested
in
funding
a
lifestyle
business
anyhow
�
they
want
a
slice
of
a
big
payoff
at
the
end,
and
have
no
interest
in
your
lifestyle.
Bank
loans
for
small
businesses
are
difficult
to
come
by
these
days
(unless
they
are
backed
by
collateral),
which
really
only
leaves
bootstrapping
and
crowd-funding
as
options
anyhow.
This
is
all
for
the
best,
however.
Self-funding
your
new
business
means
that
you
have
no
investors
who
can
demand
that
you
do
things
their
way,
and
it
means
that
the
profits
from
your
business
are
entirely
your
own
going
forward.
The
good
news
is
that
many
modern
businesses
do
not
require
a
large
cash
outlay
up
front
�
often,
all
you
need
is
a
website,
a
computer,
and
an
Internet
connection
�
plus
that
financial
safety
net
we
talked
about
earlier.
No
dependencies.
Think
about
what
or
who
your
new
business
will
depend
upon
for
success.
Of
course,
you'll
depend
on
your
customer
base
�
but
are
there
other
dependencies
outside
of
your
control
that
could
get
in
your
way?
A
good
example
is
a
company
that
relies
on
government
contracts.
Will
you
get
paid
the
next
time
Congress
forces
the
government
into
a
temporary
shutdown?
Do
you
know
all
of
the
arcane
paperwork
and
regulations
that
are
required
in
order
to
actually
get
paid
by
the
government
in
a
timely
manner?
Do
you
know
how
long
it
takes
for
a
government
contract
to
get
awarded
before
you
receive
a
penny
from
it?
There's
a
lot
in
this
example
that's
outside
of
your
control,
which
can
absolutely
kill
a
new
business
that's
starting
out.
A
more
common
problem
is
relying
on
suppliers
for
your
business
that
may
not
be
able
to
deliver
what
you
need
on
time
or
to
your
specifications.
If
you�re
selling
stuff
that
other
people
provide,
make
sure
you
have
a
pool
of
potential
suppliers
to
use
in
case
one
doesn�t
work
out.
Freedom
to
work
where
you
want.
If
your
business
requires
physical
interaction
with
people,
you're
thinking
too
small.
By
tying
yourself
to
people
in
a
specific
location,
you
are
both
giving
up
some
freedom
and
limiting
your
growth
potential.
Instead
of
planning
to
open
up
a
beauty
salon
for
local
individuals,
consider
selling
beauty
products
on
the
Internet
to
people
around
the
entire
world
all
at
once.
Then,
if
your
business
becomes
successful,
you
have
the
freedom
to
move
to
Tahiti
without
losing
a
single
customer
in
the
process.
If
freedom
from
commuting
and
freedom
of
location
are
important
to
you,
it's
also
important
to
plan
a
business
that
does
not
involve
hiring
employees
that
require
your
physical
oversight.
As
your
business
grows,
can
you
start
hiring
freelancers
and
independent
contractors
remotely
to
help
out?
Can
you
outsource
much
of
what
you
do?
If
so,
that's
a
business
that
can
scale
beyond
your
own
time
and
one
that
offers
the
most
freedom.
If
your
business
is
such
that
you
must
hire
people
that
require
face-to-face
management
in
order
to
grow,
then
you're
going
to
find
yourself
tied
to
an
office
where
you
must
be
physically
present
at
least
as
long
as
your
employees
are.
You're
giving
up
a
lot
of
the
benefits
of
self-employment
in
that
case.
No
commute.
One
of
those
benefits
is
not
dealing
with
a
daily
commute,
and
reclaiming
those
hours
of
your
life.
If
your
customers
are
all
concentrated
inside
the
city,
you
live
in
the
suburbs,
and
your
product
is
such
that
you
need
a
physical
presence
with
your
customers
�
you�re
doing
it
wrong
on
many
counts.
First
of
all,
the
fact
that
you
require
a
physical
presence
with
your
customers
violates
the
first
tenet
of
"unlimited
growth
potential"
�
you
can
only
make
as
many
sales
as
you
have
time
to
see
your
customers
physically.
Maybe
you're
a
contractor
who
must
be
at
a
client's
office
you
must
commute
to
�
but
again,
such
a
business
cannot
scale
beyond
the
time
you
have
available.
Freedom
to
work
when
you
want.
Yet
again,
this
comes
back
to
the
theme
of
not
creating
a
business
that
requires
face-to-face
contact
with
your
clients.
If
your
business
is
one
such
that
you
supply
products,
not
services,
to
customers
�
then
as
long
as
you
respond
to
their
messages
within
a
day,
they
will
generally
be
happy.
You
can
choose
to
batch
up
all
of
those
messages
and
handle
them
in
the
same
hour
every
day,
or
respond
to
them
throughout
whatever
window
of
time
you
decide
to
dedicate
to
your
work.
But
when
that
is
remains
up
to
you,
and
you
have
the
flexibility
to
change
it
as
needed.
Avoiding
employees,
or
contractors
who
require
close
supervision,
is
also
required
to
let
you
manage
your
time
as
you
see
fit.
If
you
have
someone
working
for
you
from
9-5
that
isn't
experienced
enough
to
work
independently,
then
you
too
need
to
be
available
from
9-5.
If
you
aren't,
you'll
have
someone
wasting
their
time
figuring
stuff
out
on
their
own,
or
doing
things
incorrectly,
and
still
sticking
you
with
the
bill
for
that
time.
Freedom
to
work
how
you
want.
A
big
part
of
why
you're
considering
self-employment
is
because
you
want
to
be
your
own
boss.
But
certain
kinds
of
businesses
afford
more
creative
freedom
than
others.
As
mentioned
earlier,
freelancing
is
a
good
way
to
keep
paying
the
bills
during
the
early
stage
of
your
business,
but
as
a
freelancer
you're
just
trading
your
old
boss
for
a
bunch
of
new
ones:
your
clients,
who
all
want
things
produced
to
their
exact
specifications.
Working
for
a
client
as
a
freelancer
isn't
all
that
much
different
than
being
an
employee,
except
you
probably
don't
have
to
go
to
as
many
meetings,
and
you're
hopefully
paid
more
per
hour
to
compensate
for
your
lack
of
benefits.
I
will
again
caution
against
taking
on
investors,
even
it's
from
Uncle
Bob
or
Mom
&
Dad.
As
soon
as
someone
other
than
you
has
a
financial
stake
in
your
endeavor,
they
will
probably
want
some
ability
to
call
the
shots.
It
may
be
well-meaning
advice,
but
if
their
money
is
on
the
line,
you
can
bet
they
expect
you
to
act
upon
it.
Free
advice,
without
strings,
is
easy
to
get
�
you
don't
need
investors
for
that.
This
is
why
I
advise
starting
your
business
before
you
quit
your
day
job,
if
at
all
possible.
Choosing
a
business
that
does
not
require
a
large
cash
outlay
up
front
can
make
that
possible.
My
advice
so
far
is
admittedly
self-centered.
I'm
telling
you
to
avoid
hiring
people,
avoid
involving
investors,
and
avoid
creating
a
business
that
depends
on
strong
ties
to
your
local
community.

This
might
go
against
everything
you've
been
taught
all
your
life
about
being
a
good
member
of
the
community.
If
you
want
to
remain
tied
to
that
community
indefinitely
and
have
your
schedule
revolve
around
them,
that's
fine.
Perhaps
creating
local
jobs
and
new,
deeper
relationships
with
members
of
your
community
is
in
fact
what
motivates
you.
I
won't
stop
you.
Just
understand
what
you're
giving
up
�
if
your
business
takes
off,
you're
still
going
to
be
tied
to
a
local
office
working
9-5.
You
won't
have
the
option
to
up
and
move
someplace
warm
and
work
whenever
you
want
to,
without
the
need
to
sell
your
company
or
to
give
up
its
revenue
stream.
Working
out
of
a
beachside
caf�
in
Hawaii
a
few
years
from
now
will
be
how
your
story
ends,
only
if
you
craft
your
business
with
that
end
in
mind.
To
maximize
your
personal
freedom,
your
business
must
be
portable,
global,
and
avoid
full-time
employees
that
cannot
be
easily
replaced
or
managed
remotely.


CASE
STUDY:
SUNDOG
SOFTWARE
This
isn't
all
just
empty
advice
�
it
reflects
what
I've
actually
done
myself.
So,
let
me
give
you
the
story
of
my
own
company,
Sundog
Software
LLC,
and
how
it
was
designed
to
maximize
the
advantages
of
self-employment.
In
all
honesty,
"designed"
might
be
too
strong
of
a
word
�
a
lot
of
it
was
lucky
choices.
But
you
can
learn
from
how
it
worked
out.
Sundog
Software
specializes
in
real-time
computer
graphics
software
for
environmental
effects.
Think
of
skies,
clouds,
and
oceans
in
video
games,
training
simulators,
and
the
like.
It's
a
niche,
but
it's
something
I
enjoy
and
do
well.
I
license
my
software
to
companies
like
big
defense
contractors,
aerospace
companies,
flight
simulator
enthusiasts,
and
game
developers.
Today
it
earns
over
$300,000
per
year
in
revenue,
and
the
vast
majority
of
that
is
profit.
It
has
unlimited
growth
potential,
because
after
developing
this
software,
I'm
able
to
sell
it
to
as
many
people
as
I
want
to
without
investing
significant
additional
time.
I
do
need
to
fix
bugs
and
keep
my
products
modern,
but
those
efforts
are
shared
with
all
of
my
customers
at
once.
There
is
no
linear
relationship
with
my
number
of
customers
and
the
number
of
hours
I
need
to
work.
My
software
is
a
digital
product,
so
I
have
no
costs
for
manufacturing
or
shipping
to
deal
with.
Customers
all
over
the
world
can
order
software
licenses
on
my
website
with
a
credit
card,
at
which
point
they
automatically
receive
a
download
of
their
product.
Online
advertising
campaigns
seek
out
new
customers
and
direct
them
to
my
website
automatically.
Prospective
customers
may
obtain
product
information,
demos,
and
trial
versions
from
my
website
without
interacting
with
me
at
all.
I
literally
earn
money
while
I
sleep.
I
started
developing
this
software
as
a
hobby,
while
I
was
still
working
in
a
conventional
job.
Since
it's
something
I
enjoy,
it
didn't
really
feel
like
work.
But
I
soon
realized
that
what
I
made
had
commercial
value,
and
I
started
offering
it
for
sale
online
at
a
low
price
just
to
test
the
market.
I
used
some
bonus
money
to
pay
a
web
designer
to
develop
a
WordPress-based
storefront
for
my
new
product,
and
quickly
earned
that
money
back.
Note
that
I
was
careful
to
review
the
terms
of
my
employment
at
the
time.
They
were
remarkably
generous
with
regards
to
side
endeavors
such
as
this.
Still,
I
was
careful
to
only
work
on
this
using
my
own
time
and
equipment.
If
you
aren't
careful
about
this
sort
of
thing,
you
could
end
up
with
your
current
employer
laying
a
claim
to
whatever
you
created
on
your
own,
or
being
upset
about
your
"moonlighting"
enough
to
put
your
day
job
in
jeopardy.
Even
though
I
knew
I
was
playing
by
the
rules
in
my
case
(and
it
was
actually
helping
to
keep
my
technical
skills
up
for
my
day
job),
it's
still
not
something
I
talked
about
much
at
work.
The
important
point
is
that
I
did
not
take
out
any
loans
or
outside
investment
to
get
a
proof-of-concept
product
into
the
market.
I
did
it
on
my
own
time,
with
my
own
money,
while
I
still
had
a
steady
source
of
income.
This
way,
I
was
only
investing
in
myself
�
the
company
that
resulted
was
entirely
mine.
By
the
time
I
was
forced
to
leave
my
day
job
due
to
personal
circumstances,
even
the
10
hours
or
so
per
week
I
was
devoting
to
my
little
"hobby"
was
resulting
in
almost
enough
revenue
to
live
off
of.
I
had
enough
saved
up
to
cover
living
expenses
for
a
few
months,
and
I
could
afford
to
provide
my
own
health
insurance
for
a
while.
So,
I
took
a
gamble
that
with
a
full-time
effort,
I
could
grow
this
business
into
something
my
family
could
live
comfortably
from.
I
started
off
doing
a
lot
of
freelance
work
as
a
software
developer,
and
found
that
with
my
professional
connections
and
the
demand
for
experienced
software
engineers,
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
come
by.
I
was
also
surprised
to
find
that
nobody
even
blinks
at
paying
$150
per
hour
for
an
experienced
software
engineer.
My
paranoia
about
depleting
my
savings
and
having
to
seek
a
new
job
went
away
pretty
quickly.
But
I
was
still
working
hard
to
meet
the
high
expectations
my
clients
had,
so
in
many
ways
it
still
felt
like
I
had
a
job,
and
not
a
business.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
investing
just
as
much
time
into
growing
Sundog
Software.
I
worked
to
optimize
my
automated
targeted
marketing
through
Google
AdWords
and
display
ads
on
specific
websites.
I
raised
my
prices
after
evaluating
the
market.
I
started
sending
press
releases
out
to
publications
my
customers
read,
which
doesn't
cost
anything.
I
started
building
up
an
email
list
and
sending
out
regular
newsletters.
All
of
that
paid
off,
and
money
from
freelancing
soon
just
became
extra
income.
I
stopped
seeking
new
freelance
work
after
a
few
months.
At
this
point,
I
was
working
entirely
out
of
my
home,
so
I
had
no
commute.
All
I
needed
to
create
my
software
and
market
it
was
a
computer
and
an
Internet
connection.
I
was
creating
all
of
this
on
my
own,
so
I
had
no
dependencies
�
nobody
could
stop
me
from
delivering
my
product.
My
products
were
intentionally
of
a
scope
such
that
I
could
build
them
myself,
but
still
be
large
and
complex
enough
that
they
would
be
difficult
for
a
competitor
to
replicate.
Growing
my
business
occasionally
required
skills
or
time
that
I
didn't
have.
But
instead
of
hiring
employees
I
wasn't
sure
I
could
afford
in
the
long
run,
I
contracted
out
specific
tasks
to
other
freelance
software
developers
and
artists
that
worked
out
of
their
own
offices
using
their
own
equipment.
Since
these
freelancers
were
experienced
enough
to
work
independently
given
spec�d
out
work,
I
was
able
to
hire
them
from
across
the
globe
and
without
face
to
face
interaction.
This
way,
I
preserved
my
freedom
to
work
where
I
want.
Since
I
was
selling
my
product
over
the
Internet,
I
soon
found
myself
with
customers
all
over
the
world,
from
every
time
zone.
There
was
no
expectation
to
meet
with
me
face
to
face,
because
they
knew
I
lived
far
away.
Had
I
restricted
myself
to
selling
in
my
immediate
area,
my
business
would
not
have
lasted
a
month.
E-mail
communication
with
my
customers
became
the
norm,
and
as
long
as
they
received
a
response
within
a
day,
they
felt
I
was
being
responsive.
So,
I
could
choose
whatever
part
of
the
day
I
wanted
to
communicate
with
my
customers,
preserving
my
freedom
to
work
when
I
want.
In
fact,
I've
found
it's
much
more
efficient
to
let
these
messages
pile
up
for
a
day
and
deal
with
them
all
at
once,
rather
than
waiting
around
all
day
for
new
messages
to
come
in
that
you
must
respond
to.
At
no
point
did
I
take
on
outside
investment,
a
partner,
or
a
board
of
advisors
with
a
stake
in
the
company.
So,
I
had
the
freedom
to
work
how
I
want.
As
someone
who
is
newly
self-employed,
you
will
need
advice
from
others,
but
I
found
this
through
my
local
business
incubator
and
by
interviewing
CEO's
of
other,
similar
small
companies
that
did
not
compete
directly
with
my
own.
This
gave
me
lots
of
free,
but
non-binding,
advice
to
work
with.
An
important
choice
was
choosing
a
business
that
delivers
digital
goods
over
the
Internet
�
ones
that
are
not
easily
replicated
by
others.

A
digital,
Internet-based
business
may
be
run
from
anywhere
on
any
schedule,
and
scales
up
seamlessly.
The
other
important
choice
was
designing
a
business
that
could
be
managed
single-handedly,
with
help
from
the
occasional
contractor
or
freelancer.
This
prevented
getting
tied
down
to
a
physical
office
with
full-time
employees
to
manage,
while
still
allowing
for
growth
in
the
company.


OTHER
LIFESTYLE
BUSINESS
IDEAS
You
don't
have
to
be
a
software
developer
to
maximize
the
benefits
of
self-employment.
Here
are
some
other
ideas
of
businesses
that
scale
well
without
needing
to
hire
a
large
full-time
staff:
Selling
stuff
on
the
Internet.
It's
still
possible
to
earn
a
decent
living
selling
unique
goods
on
sites
like
Amazon,
EBay,
and
Etsy.
The
trick
is
finding
a
niche
that
isn't
currently
well-served.
What
weird
things
are
you
passionate
about?
Is
it
just
weird
enough
that
there
aren't
many
people
producing
merchandise
for
that
interest,
but
not
so
weird
that
there
is
no
real
market
for
it?
The
other
trick
is
selling
something
unique
�
if
you're
selling
some
commodity
like
electronics
that
any
other
retailer
can
offer,
probably
at
a
lower
price,
people
will
have
no
reason
to
buy
from
you.

Do
your
research
�
search
for
existing
offerings
and
understand
your
competition
before
diving
in.
Also
research
the
size
of
the
market;
get
a
Google
AdWords
account,
and
that
will
let
you
look
up
the
popularity
of
specific
search
terms,
which
is
a
decent
metric
of
what
interests
are
more
popular
than
others.
Through
the
magic
of
drop-shipping,
you
may
be
even
be
able
to
separate
yourself
from
the
work
of
producing
and
distributing
your
product.
This
is
also
something
you
can
try
out
on
the
weekends,
before
quitting
your
day
job.
Build
an
Online
Marketplace
for
Services.
Although
I
generally
recommend
selling
products
instead
of
services,
in
this
case,
services
are
the
product.
You're
not
directly
responsible
for
the
services
provided;
you
just
connect
contractors
and
freelancers
with
clients
for
a
fee.
Angie's
List
is
one
extreme
of
this
idea,
but
you
could
imagine
building
similar
marketplaces
for
niche
industries.
Finding
reliable
software
engineer
freelancers,
for
example,
is
still
a
challenge.
Again,
this
is
an
idea
you
can
start
up
with
minimal
cash
and
time
up
front,
and
see
if
it
grows
before
quitting
the
day
job.
Write
Books.
I'm
trying
this
one
out
right
now,
myself!
I
saw
that
there
were
surprisingly
few
books
on
the
topic
of
self-employment
and
lifestyle
businesses,
and
writing
one
isn't
that
much
work
�
so
why
not
try
it?
Once
it's
written,
it
can
generate
revenue
for
years.
If
you
have
an
area
of
expertise
that's
in
demand,
but
niche
enough
that
there
aren't
a
lot
of
traditional
educational
options
on
it
�
odds
are
other
people
want
to
learn
about
it,
and
might
stumble
across
your
book
in
the
process.
Now
that
self-publishing
and
digital
distribution
of
books
is
actually
a
viable
business
model,
a
book
sold
for
a
few
dollars
can
still
reach
a
large
number
of
readers
and
generate
decent
income.
As
with
everything,
it's
about
finding
an
underserved
niche
�
I
hope
the
world
needs
this
book,
but
it
probably
doesn't
need
another
vampire
romance
novel.
Develop
Online
Courses.
As
college
tuition
becomes
increasingly
expensive,
more
people
are
turning
to
online
courses
such
as
those
offered
through
Coursera,
Udemy,
and
General
Assembly.
These
companies
rely
on
instructors
to
create
these
courses,
and
in
some
cases
share
the
profits
with
them.
If
you
have
a
niche
skill
that�s
in
demand,
creating
some
instructional
videos
on
these
platforms
will
generate
ongoing
revenue
streams.
Some
people
make
entire
businesses
out
of
instructional
content
creation.
Build
a
website
that
helps
people
find
hard-to-find
stuff.
For
years,
I've
been
scouring
art
fairs
trying
to
find
a
painting
that
will
actually
look
good
on
my
wall
at
a
reasonable
price.
That
wall
is
still
empty.
That's
just
one
example
of
a
market
where
people
have
money
to
spend,
but
a
hard
time
actually
spending
it.
There
are
so
many
artisans
out
there
in
the
world
that
it
can
be
hard
to
find
something
that
fits
your
own
tastes
and
needs
among
all
the
other
stuff
that's
available.
Solving
that
problem
in
a
creative
way
could
be
valuable,
and
perhaps
extensible
to
areas
other
than
art.
None
of
these
ideas
are
guaranteed
to
be
successful,
but
they
are
all
things
you
can
potentially
prototype
just
with
your
own
spare
time,
throw
them
out
there,
and
see
if
they
have
legs.
Other
ways
to
get
your
creative
juices
flowing
would
be
to
watch
"Shark
Tank"
or
similar
shows
where
investors
evaluate
small
businesses
on
TV,
subscribe
to
a
feed
from
TechCrunch
to
see
what
ideas
are
coming
out
of
Silicon
Valley,
and
most
importantly
�
find
enough
time
to
actually
be
able
to
think
creatively.
If
you're
running
yourself
ragged
from
your
day
job's
day
to
day
responsibilities,
you'll
be
hard
pressed
to
find
the
mental
energy
to
conjure
up
original
ideas.
Instead
of
leaning
in
to
your
career,
perhaps
you're
better
off
leaning
out
a
bit.
Also,
stay
vigilant
for
unsolved
problems
you
encounter
in
your
day
to
day
life.
Have
you
ever
searched
for
a
certain
kind
of
product
only
to
find
it
is
unavailable
or
hard
to
find?
Did
you
do
anything
today
that
forced
you
to
waste
time
you'd
rather
have
back?
These
may
represent
opportunities
to
fill
an
underserved
need
with
your
own
business.
Keep
a
list
of
these
opportunities
as
you
run
across
them,
and
eventually
one
may
get
you
excited
enough
to
do
something
about
it.


KEY
POINTS
WHEN
EVALUATING
YOUR
BUSINESS
IDEA
If
you've
got
an
idea
of
what
you'd
like
to
do
while
self-employed,
here
are
a
few
good
questions
to
ask
yourself.
Can
I
test
this
idea
before
I
quit
my
day
job?
This
question
is
important
for
two
reasons:
one,
it
evaluates
if
you
can
eliminate
the
risk
involved
in
trying
out
your
idea
�
worst
case,
you
still
have
your
day
job.
Two,
it
validates
this
is
something
you
can
accomplish
yourself
or
with
minimal
freelance
help.
That
makes
it
much
easier
to
self-fund,
it
keeps
your
ongoing
expenses
low,
and
it
frees
you
from
the
responsibilities
that
come
with
hiring
people.
Remember
to
check
your
employment
agreement,
and
ensure
working
on
this
business
won�t
violate
the
terms
of
your
employment
or
compete
with
your
current
employer.
Does
this
idea
scale
well?
A
digital
product,
or
a
product
that
can
be
manufactured
by
others,
will
free
up
your
time
after
the
initial
product
creation.
Once
your
product
is
developed,
you
can
focus
on
things
like
PR,
marketing,
and
developing
new
products
to
grow
your
business
further.
You
can
sell
as
many
of
them
as
you
wish.
In
contrast,
a
product
you
must
personally
create
by
hand
for
each
customer
is
limited
by
the
amount
of
time
you
have
to
create
it.
Even
worse,
selling
your
time
as
a
service
billed
hourly
can
never
scale
beyond
the
number
of
productive
hours
you
have
in
a
week.
Products
and
information
may
be
replicated
without
limit,
but
your
time
is
fixed
in
quantity.
Have
I
found
an
underserved
niche?
Sundog
Software
started
with
the
observation
that
realistic
3D
clouds
were
very
hard
to
produce
in
flight
simulators
and
games.
Yet,
this
niche
was
not
so
small
that
there
was
no
business
to
be
had
�
big
companies
with
very
deep
pockets
are
behind
many
simulators
and
games.
Ask
yourself
what
solutions
already
exist
for
the
problem
your
business
will
solve,
and
whether
you
can
do
it
better
or
at
lower
cost.
If
the
answer
is
yes,
do
some
research
on
your
market
to
make
sure
there
is
enough
demand
for
your
product
to
end
up
paying
your
bills.
Estimating
market
sizes
is
probably
worthy
of
another
book
of
its
own.
Websites
such
as
Alexa,
or
the
keyword
tool
in
Google
AdWords,
can
be
useful
for
measuring
trends
and
overall
interest
for
a
given
topic.
Some
key
advice
is
to
always
estimate
a
market
size
from
the
bottom-up,
instead
of
from
the
top-down.
For
example,
don't
estimate
the
size
of
your
market
by
saying
X%
of
the
7
billion
people
on
the
planet
might
be
interested
in
it
�
that
will
almost
always
grossly
overestimate
it.
Instead,
start
with
a
more
realistic
estimate
of
the
number
of
customers
in
your
local
area
or
in
similar
niches,
and
work
your
way
up.
You
want
to
find
how
many
people
will
actually
shell
out
their
hard-earned
cash
for
your
product,
not
how
many
are
just
potentially
interested
in
it.
You
also
need
to
understand
any
existing
competitors
in
your
niche.
How
will
your
company
differentiate
itself?
How
much
of
your
sales
do
you
expect
competitors
to
consume
initially,
and
in
the
long
term?
The
market
you
have
found
may
not
be
entirely
yours,
and
you
need
to
factor
that
into
your
revenue
projections.
Market
research
is
a
field
unto
itself,
but
you
don�t
have
to
make
a
science
out
of
it.
Use
whatever
data
you
can
find
to
estimate
the
number
of
potential
customers
for
your
product,
and
use
the
Internet
to
discover
competitors
and
how
they
seem
to
be
doing.
In
the
end,
estimating
your
market
size
is
an
educated
guess.
You
just
want
to
educate
yourself
with
any
relevant
data
and
competitive
intelligence
you
can
find.
Do
my
customers
have
money?
I
made
this
mistake
myself
once.
My
business
started
off
selling
primarily
to
big
defense
contractors
and
aerospace
companies
with
big
budgets,
but
my
products
were
also
relevant
to
video
game
developers.
My
market
research
showed
there
were
over
a
million
people
across
the
world
that
call
themselves
game
developers
�
so
marketing
to
them
seemed
like
a
sure
path
to
riches.
What
I
didn't
take
into
consideration
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
game
developers
are
kids
living
at
home,
using
free
tools
to
create
games
that
will
never
see
the
light
of
day.
Even
the
ones
that
are
doing
it
professionally
are
usually
working
with
little
to
no
budget.
I
found
plenty
of
customers
in
game
development
�
but
very
little
revenue.
Make
sure
your
potential
customers
not
only
have
an
interest
in
your
product,
but
also
the
budgets
or
disposable
income
required
to
purchase
it
at
the
price
you
need
to
make
a
profit.
Can
I
sell
this
globally?
Can
you
accept
orders
over
the
Internet,
and
deliver
your
product
or
services
wherever
it
is
needed?
If
so,
you
are
maximizing
the
size
of
your
market,
and
also
insulating
yourself
from
economic
or
political
crises
that
may
be
specific
to
one
country.
As
an
example,
the
US
restricted
its
defense
spending
in
recent
years.
If
my
only
customers
were
in
the
US
training
and
simulation
industry,
my
business
would
be
stagnant
�
but
now,
most
of
my
customers
are
in
Canada,
Europe
or
Asia
instead,
and
business
continues
to
grow.
If
you
are
selling
globally,
then
you
are
also
competing
globally.
Understanding
your
competition
on
a
global
scale
then
becomes
especially
important.
Is
someone
in
a
country
with
a
lower
cost
of
living
already
offering
what
you
do
just
as
well,
but
at
a
much
lower
cost?
If
so,
that's
a
problem.
Can
I
automate
sales
and
marketing?
If
you
are
selling
your
products
globally
over
the
Internet,
traditional
sales
techniques
such
as
cold-calling
and
doing
in-person
demos
simply
cannot
scale.
Hiring
a
salesperson
probably
won't
help
you,
since
that
person
can't
be
everywhere
at
once.
Can
you
find
new
customers
through
what
they
are
searching
for
on
Google,
or
what
demographics
and
interests
they
state
they
have
on
Facebook?
Are
there
specific
websites
or
publications
that
your
customers
tend
to
visit
that
you
could
advertise
on?
Can
you
direct
these
people
to
a
web
page
designed
to
get
them
to
try
out
your
product,
right
then
and
there,
free
of
obligation
and
with
little
expense
to
you?
If
you
can
answer
yes
to
those
questions,
then
you
may
be
able
to
automate
much
of
your
sales
and
marketing.
Since
we're
trying
to
maximize
the
value
you
get
out
of
your
business
with
limited
human
resources,
it's
important
to
build
systems
that
can
allow
a
customer
to
discover,
evaluate,
and
buy
your
product
without
involving
you
personally.
Is
this
business
hard
to
replicate?
With
seven
billion
people
in
the
world
and
more
getting
born
every
minute,
it's
hard
to
find
a
unique
idea.
When
you
do,
it
probably
won't
stay
unique
for
long
�
and
the
niche
you
are
serving
can
only
support
so
many
of
you.
If
you're
selling
a
physical
product,
see
if
it's
something
you
can
at
least
apply
for
a
provisional
patent
for.
This
is
basically
a
way
to
protect
your
idea
at
a
low
cost
for
a
period
of
time,
while
you
build
up
enough
profit
to
pay
for
a
real
patent
application
(that
will
run
you
about
$10,000
by
the
way).
Your
patent
is
only
as
good
as
your
ability
to
defend
it,
but
having
one
will
make
it
easier
to
sell
your
business
in
the
future.
I
am
not
a
lawyer,
so
you'll
need
to
talk
to
yours
for
details.
If
your
business
is
not
something
that
lends
itself
to
patent
or
copyright
protection,
you
at
least
need
to
make
sure
what
you
are
doing
is
unlikely
to
be
replicated.
Sometimes
this
means
you
are
leveraging
your
own
unique
skills,
interests,
and
talents
to
do
something
that
is
insurmountably
hard
for
most
others.
Even
a
patent
or
copyright
is
no
guarantee
your
work
won't
be
stolen
�
what
can
you
really
do
if
someone
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
takes
your
work
and
starts
selling
it
as
their
own?
Be
sure
to
take
steps
to
make
that
as
difficult
to
do
as
possible,
because
it
will
happen.
It
happened
to
me.
As
much
as
people
hate
digital
rights
management,
it
is
something
you
must
think
about
if
you
plan
to
make
a
living
selling
digital
products.
Don�t
buy
into
the
idea
that
pirates
wouldn�t
have
paid
for
your
digital
goods
anyhow
�
once
one
of
my
own
products
for
amateur
game
developers
showed
up
on
a
popular
pirate
site,
its
sales
went
almost
to
zero.
Is
a
large
company
likely
to
decide
they
want
your
market,
throw
more
resources
at
it
than
you
will
ever
have,
and
offer
a
competing
product
for
free
just
to
gain
the
market?
That's
a
really
fast
way
to
go
out
of
business;
the
most
you
can
hope
for
is
that
they'll
want
to
acquire
you
first,
or
hire
you
after
they've
ruined
you.
Your
only
real
protection
against
this,
apart
from
patent
protection,
is
to
serve
a
niche
that
large
companies
are
unlikely
to
find
interesting
enough
to
go
after.
I'm
quite
happy
with
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollars
per
year
coming
out
of
my
little
niche,
but
that's
chump
change
to
a
large
company
and
not
even
worth
talking
about.
If
you
really
have
found
a
millions-of-dollars-per-year
opportunity
and
you
can't
protect
it,
it's
probably
a
matter
of
time
before
a
larger
company
will
identify
that
same
opportunity.
In
this
case,
you
may
be
better
off
going
down
the
riskier
"growth
business"
path
instead
of
a
lifestyle
business,
with
the
objective
of
gaining
traction
in
the
marketplace
before
others
do,
and
getting
acquired
by
that
larger
company
down
the
road.
That's
all
a
big
gamble,
however.
Am
I
going
to
get
sued?
The
flipside
of
protecting
your
intellectual
property
is
ensuring
that
you're
not
inadvertently
infringing
somebody
else's.
Check
that
the
name
of
your
proposed
business
has
not
been
trademarked
or
is
in
use
already
for
a
similar
business
�
if
so,
find
another
name.
Search
the
US
Patent
and
Trademark
Office
database
online
to
see
if
you
are
basing
your
business
on
an
idea
that
has
already
been
patented,
to
the
best
of
your
ability.
What
about
your
proposed
website
domain
name?
If
someone's
already
using
it,
that
could
be
a
problem.
At
a
minimum,
do
a
Google
search
of
what
you
plan
to
name
your
business
and
make
sure
nobody's
going
to
be
confused
between
your
business
and
some
other
one
that's
already
out
there.
That's
a
really
fast
way
to
get
a
cease-and-desist
letter.
Your
lawyer
can
help
in
these
searches,
and
it's
usually
money
well
spent.
In
the
field
of
technology,
there's
no
realistic
way
to
know
for
sure
that
you're
not
infringing
a
patent
that
some
patent
troll
might
come
after
you
over.
If
you
haven�t
heard
of
patent
trolls,
they
are
companies
that
don�t
actually
build
anything,
but
amass
the
rights
to
other
peoples�
patents
for
the
sole
purpose
of
extorting
licensing
fees
from
people
who
are
inadvertently
infringing
them.
Your
only
real
defense
here
is
being
too
small
for
the
patent
trolls
to
notice.
If
they
know
you
don't
have
enough
money
for
them
to
extort
a
meaningful
amount
from
you,
they
won't
waste
their
time
with
you
�
usually.
There
are
notable
exceptions,
such
as
Uniloc's
suit
against
Laminar
Technologies
(go
look
it
up.)
It's
still
worth
checking
to
the
best
of
your
ability
to
make
sure
you
aren't
building
your
business
on
top
of
an
idea
that's
already
been
patented.
If
not,
then
consider
patenting
it
yourself!
These
questions
are
just
the
start
�
we
haven't
yet
figured
out
if
this
business
really
can
sustain
an
ever-improving
lifestyle
going
forward.
To
do
that,
we
need
a
business
model.


WRITING
YOUR
BUSINESS
PLAN
If
you're
seeking
investment
or
a
loan,
then
you'll
be
required
to
have
a
business
plan.
Hopefully
you
are
not
doing
either
of
those
things,
but
there
is
still
value
in
having
a
business
plan.
It
serves
as
a
sanity
check
that
you
have
some
sort
of
path
to
success.
You
are
not
going
to
bet
the
farm
on
your
business
plan,
as
it
is
almost
certainly
going
to
prove
to
be
wrong.
You
don't
know
how
the
market
will
react
to
your
business
until
you
have
it
in
the
marketplace,
and
you
can
measure
that
reaction.
What
you
learn
can
and
should
cause
you
to
deviate
from
your
original
business
plan,
and
find
a
different,
better,
path
to
success.
But
if
you
can't
even
come
up
with
one
path
to
success
in
a
business
plan,
then
you
have
a
problem.
It's
time
to
go
back
to
the
idea
generation
stage.
There's
no
one
specific
format
for
a
business
plan,
but
here
are
the
sections
from
the
one
I
used.
Countless
books
are
available
just
on
writing
business
plans,
if
you�d
like
to
examine
alternative
models.

�The
Secrets
to
Writing
a
Successful
Business
Plan�
by
Hal
Shelton
is
one
popular
example.
BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION
AND
VISION
This
is
where
you
ensure
you
possess
clarity
of
thought
about
what
you
are
going
to
build.
Can
you
come
up
with
a
mission
statement
for
your
new
company
that
can
fit
on
a
T-shirt?
Your
mission
can
and
should
be
succinct.
Here
is
mine:
Sundog
Software's
mission
is
to
power
truly
immersive
outdoor
virtual
worlds
for
simulation,
training,
and
entertainment
experiences.
Note
that
my
mission
is
specific,
but
open-ended
enough
to
allow
for
future
product
expansion.
You
might
think
a
mission
statement
is
just
wasteful
word-play,
but
the
process
of
coming
up
with
one
forces
you
to
think
about
what
you're
good
at,
and
how
you'll
build
products
that
leverage
what
you're
good
at.
Next,
describe
in
a
paragraph
what
you're
going
to
build,
in
no
uncertain
terms.
Look
ahead
five
years,
and
say
what
you
would
like
your
company
to
evolve
into
in
that
time.
What
sorts
of
new
products
might
you
extend
into?
What
are
realistic,
measurable
goals
for
your
business
over
the
next
five
years?
You
probably
won't
hit
all
of
them,
but
knowing
they
are
attainable
and
measurable
is
what's
important.
Are
the
attainable
goals
you
came
up
with
more
than
enough
to
fund
the
lifestyle
you
want?
If
not,
you
may
need
to
go
back
and
think
bigger
about
your
offering
or
your
markets.
You
may
want
to
write
the
rest
of
your
business
plan,
and
then
revisit
these
goals,
as
the
rest
of
the
plan
may
clarify
your
thinking
on
what
realistic
growth
looks
like
for
you.
Remember
you
are
writing
these
goals
for
your
own
personal
financial
planning,
and
not
to
convince
someone
to
invest
in
you
or
approve
your
project.
It�s
important
that
you
are
honest
and
realistic
with
your
goals,
and
not
just
trying
to
convince
yourself
that
your
idea
is
hugely
valuable.
DEFINITION
OF
THE
MARKET
Here's
where
you'll
get
into
more
detail
about
your
market
analysis.
Getting
this
right
is
even
more
important
than
your
mission
statement.
Your
market
analysis
validates
that
there
are
enough
people
willing
to
give
you
money
in
exchange
for
what
you
do
to
pay
your
bills.
Who
is
your
customer?
Describe
the
type
of
person
or
company
who
needs
what
you
are
going
to
offer.
Where
do
they
live?
What
do
they
do?
What
expectations
and
requirements
will
they
have
for
what
you
are
offering?
How
many
of
them
are
there?
Don't
estimate
your
market
from
the
top-down.
Saying
that
some
percentage
of
the
US
population
might
buy
your
product
is
both
lazy
and
grossly
overstated.
Understand
who
your
customers
are,
and
count
them
from
the
bottom-up.
What
data
can
you
find
about
how
many
of
them
are
really
out
there?
Can
you
find
sales
data
from
other
products
that
cater
to
the
same
market?
If
not
sales
data,
can
you
estimate
sales
based
on
the
sizes
of
the
companies
that
cater
to
them?
Think
creatively
about
ways
to
estimate
the
size
and
growth
of
your
market.
Are
there
industry
reports
available
that
discuss
the
growth
trends
of
your
market?
If
it's
shrinking,
this
might
not
be
the
best
market
to
invest
in!
Are
there
industry
organizations
that
your
customers
belong
to?
What
are
their
membership
numbers?
Think
about
the
competitive
landscape
surrounding
your
market,
and
how
willing
your
potential
customers
are
to
spend
money
solving
the
problem
your
product
solves.
Of
the
people
who
could
want
your
product,
how
many
are
likely
to
actually
buy
it?
What
other
alternatives
do
they
have
today
to
your
product
�
including
the
alternative
of
buying
nothing
at
all?
How
many
have
a
budget
to
purchase
your
item
with?
It's
important
to
do
your
homework
here.
If
possible,
have
a
friend
critique
your
analysis.
Even
better,
launch
your
product
on
the
side
and
start
collecting
real
data!
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
PRODUCT
This
is
where
you
protect
yourself
against
feature
creep,
at
least
for
your
initial
product
offering.
What
are
you
going
to
offer
to
your
customers?
You
want
to
offer
a
product
that
is
exciting
enough
to
consumers
in
order
to
get
a
fair
measurement
of
your
company's
potential,
hopefully
before
you
quit
your
day
job.
But,
you
don't
want
to
cram
so
many
features
into
it
that
you
delay
your
initial
launch,
or
complicate
your
product
unnecessarily.
It's
better
to
launch
your
initial
product,
listen
to
customer
feedback,
and
let
that
inform
future
updates
to
your
product.
The
startup
world
talks
a
lot
about
building
a
�minimal
viable
product�
(MVP),
and
that
advice
applies
equally
well
to
your
lifestyle
business.
The
book
�The
Lean
Startup�
by
Eric
Ries
covers
the
concept
of
MVP
in
much
more
detail,
and
is
worth
reading
if
you�re
new
to
product
management
in
small
businesses.
Describe
your
product
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer.
What
will
the
feature
list
on
your
website
look
like?
What
will
your
press
release
announcing
the
product
say?
What
will
your
advertisements
say?
This
should
clarify
your
thought
on
the
minimum
needed
to
offer
an
exciting
product.
Do
that,
and
no
more,
at
first.
What
price
will
you
offer
your
product
at?
Looking
at
the
prices
of
similar
or
competing
products
is
certainly
a
place
to
start.
If
there
aren't
any,
approach
your
pricing
from
a
value
standpoint.
What
value
will
your
customer
receive
from
your
product,
and
what
is
that
worth?
If
you're
having
trouble
arriving
at
a
price
point,
I
recommend
the
book
"The
1%
Windfall"
by
Rafi
Mohammed
�

it
offers
precise
approaches
for
determining
the
optimal
price
point
for
a
product,
and
getting
that
right
can
make
a
huge
difference
in
your
company's
success.
What
is
your
business
model?
This
can
make
a
huge
difference
for
your
cash
flow.
Will
you
just
offer
your
product
as
a
one-time
transaction,
or
is
there
a
subscription
that
gives
them
access
to
ongoing
support
and
updates?
Will
you
offer
payment
plans?
Subscription
models
are
popular
these
days,
as
it
removes
the
barrier
of
a
large
purchase
from
your
customers,
but
creates
an
ongoing
revenue
stream
for
you
that
may
be
more
valuable
over
the
long
term.
ORGANIZATION
AND
MANAGEMENT
Even
if
it's
just
you,
it's
worth
thinking
about
your
corporate
structure.
You
are
going
to
need
a
lawyer
and
an
accountant,
and
you
may
as
well
find
them
while
you're
still
getting
a
paycheck,
as
they
aren't
cheap.
Writing
this
section
of
your
business
plan
is
going
to
require
some
professional
advice,
but
it's
important.
There
are
complicated
issues
regarding
whether
you
structure
your
company
as
a
sole
proprietor,
a
limited-liability
company,
an
S-corporation,
or
something
else.
You
might
even
treat
your
business
as
one
sort
of
entity
for
business
purposes,
and
another
for
tax
purposes.
All
offer
different
tradeoffs
of
tax
treatment,
personal
liability,
and
accounting
complexity.
That's
just
in
the
US,
and
it
varies
from
state
to
state.
Talk
to
your
accountant
and
lawyer
to
figure
out
what
makes
sense
in
the
early
stages
of
your
business.
I
tried
to
do
it
all
myself
at
first,
and
ended
up
with
a
huge,
unexpected
tax
bill
as
a
result.
Don't
make
the
same
mistake.
Even
if
you're
just
testing
out
your
business
on
the
side,
any
profit
you
make
is
still
taxable
and
needs
to
be
dealt
with
�
and
by
doing
commerce
with
others,
you
are
opening
yourself
up
to
liability
concerns
and
things
like
intellectual
property
theft.
Go
figure
it
out
with
a
professional,
and
then
write
it
down
in
this
section
of
your
plan
before
you
forget
it
all.
It's
bound
to
be
complicated.
While
you're
talking
to
your
lawyer,
make
sure
you
understand
what's
necessary
to
obtain
the
proper
licenses
and
permits
for
your
business
as
well.
In
the
US,
you
may
require
permits
at
the
state,
county,
and
local
levels
even
to
run
a
web-based
business
out
of
your
extra
bedroom.
I
don't
know
a
good
way
to
find
reputable
accountants
and
lawyers
that
specialize
in
small
businesses
�
maybe
that's
another
business
opportunity
in
itself!
If
you
have
friends
who
run
their
own
small
business,
that's
as
good
a
place
to
start
as
any.
If
your
local
area
has
a
business
incubator
or
economic
development
office,
they
may
have
some
professionals
they
can
refer
you
to
as
well.
Getting
to
know
them
is
going
to
be
a
good
idea
anyhow.
MARKETING
AND
SALES
STRATEGY
Write
down
how
your
customers
will
discover
you.
Ideally,
this
is
largely
automated
through
website
search
engine
optimization
(SEO,)
landing
page
optimization
(LPO),
and
targeted
online
ads.
If
so,
detail
what
channels
you
are
going
to
use.
If
you
don't
know
what
SEO
and
LPO
are,
make
sure
the
person
who
builds
your
website
does.
Is
it
appropriate
to
market
your
products
through
social
media?
If
so,
which
networks?
What
is
your
strategy
for
creating
content
that
gets
shared
and
drives
traffic
to
your
business?
What
social
networks
do
your
customers
frequent?
How
much
time
will
you
dedicate
to
nurturing
your
social
network
presence?
Marketing
through
social
media
can
be
effective
and
low-cost
for
many
businesses,
but
it
requires
a
large
ongoing
time
commitment.
It�s
important
to
think
about
how
to
best
budget
your
time
on
social
media
marketing,
and
which
social
networks
might
be
the
most
effective
for
you.
Are
there
specific
websites
where
your
customers
congregate?
Can
you
advertise
on
them?
If
so,
contact
them
for
a
rate
card
and
traffic
estimates,
and
figure
out
how
much
it
might
cost
to
reach
new
customers
through
this
site.
Advertising
on
websites
highly
relevant
to
your
business
can
be
a
very
effective
way
to
attract
new
customers,
if
the
price
is
right.
Are
there
online
forums
or
mailing
lists
that
reach
your
customers
that
you
can
become
active
on?
Like
social
media,
this
is
a
free
way
to
get
in
front
of
potential
customers,
but
it
comes
with
a
time
commitment.
Your
comments
on
forums
however
tend
to
be
longer-lived
than
social
media
posts,
so
often
this
is
an
even
better
use
of
your
time
and
a
more
powerful
way
to
increase
your
site�s
ranking
on
search
engines.
Are
there
physical,
targeted
mailing
lists
you
can
send
flyers
or
postcards
to?
With
so
much
online
and
email-based
marketing
in
the
world,
old-fashioned
physical
mail
is
sometimes
an
overlooked
way
to
get
your
product
in
front
of
people.
Are
there
publications
that
cater
to
your
market
that
you
can
send
press
releases
to?
Sending
press
releases
costs
nothing,
and
can
often
result
in
free
advertising
you�d
otherwise
spend
thousands
of
dollars
for.
Perhaps
traditional
advertising
channels
such
as
magazines,
television,
radio,
or
newspapers
are
relevant
for
what
you
do.
Don't
rule
them
out
�
as
your
company
becomes
profitable,
this
can
be
a
reasonable
way
to
invest
back
into
the
business.
But
tread
carefully
�
the
effectiveness
of
these
channels
is
notoriously
hard
to
measure.
How
will
you
close
your
sales
prospects?
Ideally,
this
too
is
largely
automated
�

maybe
you
collect
an
email
address
before
giving
people
an
evaluation
of
your
product
(or
something
else
of
value
you
can
provide
at
low
or
no
cost),
and
then
they
receive
automated
follow-up
messages
over
time.
Maybe
the
simple
act
of
visiting
your
website
means
you
start
showing
more
online
ads
to
your
prospective
customers
through
what
is
known
as
"remarketing
campaigns,"
to
prod
them
into
coming
back
and
completing
their
transaction.
Once
your
customer
does
decide
to
make
a
purchase,
doing
so
should
be
quick
and
easy
online.
I
believe
the
idea
of
hiring
a
salesman
to
make
cold
calls,
do
demos,
and
harass
your
potential
customers
with
mind
games
until
they
cave
in
and
give
you
a
check
is
an
outdated
one.
For
a
business
that
relies
on
large,
business-to-business
transactions
in
a
local
area,
maybe
that
still
makes
sense.
But
for
a
global,
Internet-based
business,
your
sales
should
be
largely
automated.
If
there
is
a
larger
account
that
requires
a
personal
touch,
there
is
no
better
salesperson
than
the
founder
of
the
company,
which
is
you.
FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT
At
this
point,
you
are
armed
with
an
estimate
of
your
market
size,
its
growth
trends,
and
the
price
point
of
your
products.
Now
it's
time
to
do
the
math,
and
project
how
much
revenue
your
company
might
produce
over
time.
At
this
stage,
all
you
can
do
is
guess
as
to
what
percentage
of
your
market
you
will
capture.
This
is
called
your
"market
penetration."

It
will
depend
on
the
quality
of
your
product,
your
competition,
and
the
effectiveness
of
your
marketing.

At
least
you
have
defined
what
your
product
will
be,
and
what
your
marketing
strategy
is
�
so
it's
an
informed
guess.
These
are
all
just
back
of
the
envelope
numbers,
so
set
up
a
simple
spreadsheet
that
looks
like
this:

Year
1
Year
2
Year
3
Year
4
Year
5
Revenue





Expenses





Net
Profit






Revenue
will
be
your
estimated
market
size
times
your
market
penetration,
multiplied
again
by
how
much
each
customer
will
spend
on
you
in
a
year.
Don't
overestimate
your
initial
market
penetration
�
at
first,
nobody
has
heard
of
you,
and
it
takes
time
for
word
of
mouth
to
spread
and
for
your
products
to
mature.
Your
expenses
should
take
into
account
any
equipment,
advertising,
travel,
or
personnel
costs
�
anything
you
will
be
investing
back
into
the
business
to
keep
it
growing.
Think
about
capital
expenses:
will
you
need
new
computers,
office
furniture,
or
office
equipment?
Will
you
have
web
hosting
fees,
or
subscriptions
for
online
services
for
accounting,
email,
or
sales?
In
my
own
case,
the
biggest
expense
area
is
for
advertising,
which
is
at
least
something
you
can
spend
as
much
or
as
little
on
as
you
want
to.
If
you
will
need
to
hire
contractors
or
freelancers
to
develop
your
business,
they
will
also
end
up
being
a
large
expense.
What's
left
over
is
your
net
profit,
and
if
you
own
100%
of
your
business,
that's
basically
your
money.
You
need
to
keep
your
business
and
personal
expenses
separated
in
different
bank
accounts,
but
you
have
access
to
all
of
that
money
if
you
need
it.
You
can
always
transfer
money
from
your
business
to
your
personal
account
and
call
it
an
�owner
distribution�
for
accounting
purposes.

Keep
in
mind
however
that
this
number
is
before
taxes,
and
you
will
pay
a
higher
tax
rate
as
a
self-employed
individual
(at
least
in
the
US.)
Let's
say
you
get
to
keep
70%
of
that
number
�
these
are
all
estimates
anyhow,
so
an
exact
tax
rate
isn't
too
important.
Do
your
projections
look
like
more
than
enough
to
cover
your
average
monthly
personal
expenses?
If
so,
then
you've
got
a
viable
business
here.
Resist
the
temptation
to
fudge
these
numbers
to
make
them
look
more
promising
than
reality
dictates.
You�re
not
trying
to
sell
someone
on
your
business
idea;
rather,
this
is
a
reality
check.
If
it's
not
enough
initially,
remember
you
may
be
able
to
augment
your
income
in
the
early
years
through
freelancing
or
other
means.
But,
these
estimates
tend
to
end
up
being
overly
optimistic
�
if
they
aren't
coming
out
to
a
high
enough
number,
you
may
need
to
re-think
your
product
offering.
That's
why
we
went
through
all
of
this,
however
�
it�s
better
to
figure
this
out
now,
before
investing
a
bunch
of
time
and
money
into
your
big
idea.
Hopefully,
you
instead
have
a
pleasant
surprise
at
this
point,
and
we
can
just
move
on
to
actually
turning
your
plan
into
reality!


MAKING
YOUR
PLAN
A
REALITY
At
this
point,
you've
got
an
idea
of
how
you
might
earn
your
own
living,
and
you've
ensured
you're
in
a
position
to
try
it
out
in
the
near
future.
This
is
an
exciting
place
to
be!
As
a
family
man,
I
was
keen
on
minimizing
risk
to
my
family's
finances
during
the
transition
from
employment
to
self-employment.
These
are
the
steps
I
took.
They
require
a
period
of
hard
work,
but
the
long-term
payoff
can
be
well
worth
it
both
for
you
and
your
family.
CHECK
YOUR
EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT
You
will
need
to
take
care
that
this
side
endeavor
does
not
conflict
with
your
day
job.
You
may
end
up
more
excited
about
what
you're
building
at
home,
but
you
need
to
shift
that
excitement
to
your
job
while
you're
there.
Remember,
we're
developing
this
idea
on
the
side
in
order
to
eliminate
risk
�
but
if
it
ends
up
getting
you
fired
because
you
mentally
checked
out
of
your
day
job,
that
defeats
the
purpose!
Personally,
I
found
that
developing
software
of
my
own
on
the
side
actually
made
me
a
better
technical
manager
at
work,
and
it
also
made
me
more
aware
of
the
business
side
of
technology.
My
employer
got
a
better
employee
out
of
the
deal
while
I
was
still
there.
But
I
still
didn't
advertise
the
fact
that
I
was
working
on
my
own
thing
at
home
�
your
employer
wants
you
to
live,
eat,
think,
and
breathe
your
job,
and
admitting
that
there
are
times
when
you
don't
serves
no
good.
You
need
to
assume
that
someone
at
work
will
find
out
about
what
you're
doing,
somehow.
It's
important
to
understand
your
company's
policies
on
such
matters,
in
order
to
not
get
fired
if
that
happens.
So,
go
dig
out
your
copies
of
all
the
stuff
they
made
you
sign
when
you
accepted
your
current
job.
Don't
have
them?
Ask
Human
Resources
for
a
copy
�
they
don't
need
to
know
why.
It's
important.
Read
through
all
of
it
carefully.
If
you
don't
understand
it
all
�
well,
building
your
own
business
might
not
be
for
you,
honestly.
You're
going
to
be
creating
and
entering
into
a
lot
of
agreements
as
a
business
owner.
Still,
something
may
be
worded
in
vague
terms,
and
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
pay
for
an
hour
of
a
lawyer's
time
to
get
their
opinion
as
to
whether
your
proposed
side
business
conflicts
with
the
terms
of
your
employment.
One
common
provision
is
that
you
won't
do
anything
that
directly
competes
with
your
employer,
commonly
known
as
a
non-compete
agreement.
This
can
apply
not
only
to
subsequent
jobs,
but
to
what
you
do
in
your
spare
time.
We
can
debate
whether
such
agreements
are
enforceable
in
your
state,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
your
employer
can
make
your
life
very
uncomfortable
if
they
feel
you
violated
your
employment
agreement,
right
or
wrong.
Just
don't
go
there.
If
your
business
idea
involves
creating
the
same
sorts
of
products
your
employer
creates,
you
probably
need
to
find
a
different
idea.
Another
common
provision
is
that
you
may
not
use
company
time
or
equipment
for
personal
use.
Your
side
business
must
be
developed
entirely
on
your
own
time
and
using
your
own
equipment.
Resist
the
temptation
to
check
and
send
personal
email
or
messages
related
to
your
developing
side
business
while
you're
at
the
office.

Don't
research
stuff
about
your
side
business
at
the
office.
Don't
use
their
fax
or
copy
machine
for
it.
You
must
maintain
a
wall
between
your
day
job
and
your
side
business;
your
employer
probably
logs
everything
you
do
somewhere,
so
don't
fool
yourself
into
thinking
they
won't
find
out
about
it
if
given
a
reason
to
look.
Maintaining
that
wall
will
also
help
you
maintain
the
proper
focus
on
your
day
job
while
you
are
there.
You
should
work
on
the
assumption
that
your
side
idea
will
not
work
out,
and
your
career
growth
at
your
employer
is
still
an
important
thing
to
maintain.
Finally,
don't
put
so
many
hours
into
developing
your
side
business
that
it
limits
your
ability
to
do
your
day
job.
Don't
stay
up
until
2
AM
hacking
away
when
you
have
to
be
at
work
at
8
AM.
At
this
stage,
your
day
job
still
comes
first.
DEVELOPING
YOUR
BUSINESS
ON
THE
SIDE
This
is
the
part
where
you
work
hard.
Quitting
your
day
job
for
an
unproven
business
idea
is
an
unnecessary
amount
of
risk.
No
matter
how
wonderful
you
think
your
idea
may
be,
and
how
supportive
and
encouraging
your
friends
might
be
about
it,
in
the
end
all
that
matters
is
how
the
market
reacts
to
your
product
offering.
The
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
put
a
product
out
there,
and
see
what
happens.
Yes,
this
means
I
want
you
to
develop
your
product
before
quitting
your
day
job
�
and
that
means
putting
in
some
extra
hours.
But
it
doesn't
have
to
be
painful.
You
have
more
hours
available
during
the
week
than
you
might
realize.
Let's
say
you
spend
50
hours
a
week
dedicated
to
your
day
job,
between
actual
work
and
commuting.
And
let's
say
you
sleep
8
hours
a
day.
That
still
leaves
62
waking
hours
every
week
to
do
whatever
you
want
with.
What
are
you
doing
with
those
extra
62
hours
now?
Watching
cat
videos?
Binging
on
the
latest
hot
TV
series?
Taking
classes
just
to
fill
time?
Doing
household
chores
that
the
rest
of
your
family
can
and
should
be
helping
out
with
instead?
Hanging
out
at
bars?
Doing
extra
work
at
home
for
your
employer
that
could
wait
or
be
delegated
to
someone
else?
I'm
offering
you
a
more
productive
way
to
spend
that
time,
and
dedicate
it
to
your
own
future
instead.
All
I
ask
is
that
you
find
10
of
those
62
extra
hours
every
week
to
dedicate
toward
trying
out
your
self-employment
business.
More
is
better,
but
the
important
thing
is
to
maintain
a
steady,
diligent
effort
sustained
over
time
toward
getting
your
product
to
market.
As
long
as
those
10
hours
are
focused,
every
week
you'll
be
a
little
closer
to
your
goal,
and
eventually
you'll
be
there.
Meanwhile
you'll
have
lost
nothing,
as
you've
still
got
your
paycheck
and
benefits
coming
in.
You
will
need
to
get
the
rest
of
your
family
on
board
with
this;
that
is
10
hours
of
your
time
they
won't
have,
and
that
could
make
them
grumpy.
Explain
that
this
extra
work
has
a
good
chance
of
resulting
in
you
having
much
more
time
available
for
them
once
you
are
done,
and
you're
ultimately
doing
it
for
them
as
much
as
for
you.
Ideally,
you
can
even
get
them
involved
in
this
work
themselves.
If
not,
perhaps
you
can
find
those
few
hours
while
the
rest
of
your
family
is
asleep
or
out
of
the
house
�

that
way,
they
won't
be
disrupted,
and
they
can't
distract
you
either.
It�s
important
that
what
little
time
you
have
for
developing
your
product
is
focused.

There
is
an
entire
methodology
called
"Lean
Startup"
that
describes
building
what
your
customers
care
about,
and
nothing
more,
and
it's
achieved
almost
a
cult-like
status
among
today's
young
entrepreneurs.
I�ll
again
recommend
reading
"The
Lean
Startup"
by
Eric
Ries
as
a
good
investment;
your
spare
time
is
precious,
and
you
don't
want
to
waste
it
building
a
product
that's
more
complex
than
it
needs
to
be,
or
does
not
address
the
needs
of
your
customers.
Some
very
good
advice
is
to
interview
potential
customers
of
your
product
to
learn
more
about
the
problems
they
need
to
solve
and
how
your
product
might
solve
them.
Your
product
idea
could
change
entirely
based
on
those
conversations.
If
you�re
building
your
business
around
a
subject
area
you�re
already
proficient
in,
you
probably
know
some
potential
customers
personally
already.
They�d
probably
be
happy
to
talk
over
lunch
or
over
the
phone
to
help
you
get
started.
Just
have
an
open-ended
conversation
that
starts
with
�what
problems
in
your
business
keep
you
awake
at
night?�
If
your
product
idea
doesn�t
help
solve
them,
you
might
have
the
wrong
product!
Don't
take
the
mantra
of
Lean
as
meaning
it's
OK
to
release
a
half-assed
product.
It
means
you
are
releasing
the
product
that
meets
your
initial
customers'
needs
�
no
more,
and
no
less.
Quality
is
still
important
�
if
you
release
a
product
that
doesn't
work
or
is
esthetically
distasteful,
you'll
never
know
if
it
failed
because
it
lacked
polish
or
because
it
was
a
bad
idea.
If
your
product
does
lack
polish,
you
can
be
sure
the
only
reward
for
all
your
hard
work
will
be
a
bunch
of
negative
comments
on
the
Internet.
The
idea
may
have
been
sound,
but
if
you
only
spent
a
few
more
months
refining
your
product
before
launching
it,
the
result
could
have
been
very
different.
So,
it's
important
to
know
when
your
product
is
done.
Stick
to
your
product
definition
unless
customer
research
motivates
you
to
change
course.
When
you've
got
something
working,
realize
what
you
have
is
a
prototype
and
not
a
product
�
find
a
few
people
to
try
it
out
for
you
and
provide
feedback
before
you
release
it
to
the
world.

You
have
become
too
close
to
the
product
to
know
if
it's
good
or
not;
you
must
obtain
honest
feedback
from
others,
who
are
not
afraid
to
provide
it.
If
you�re
building
a
digital
product,
then
it�s
straightforward
how
to
create
and
refine
it.
If
you
are
building
some
sort
of
digital
service,
cloud
platforms
such
as
Amazon
Web
Services
(AWS)
can
provide
a
very
low-cost
means
of
developing
an
initial
offering,
while
still
having
a
path
toward
scaling
the
service
up
if
it
is
successful.
If
you're
at
this
point,
you're
probably
leveraging
some
of
the
same
technical
skills
that
you've
used
in
your
career,
so
you
don't
need
me
to
tell
you
what
to
do.
Building
physical
goods
is
more
involved
�
after
building
an
initial
prototype
of
your
own,
you
need
to
figure
out
how
to
make
more
of
them.
Perhaps
it
is
something
you
and
your
family
can
manufacture
in
your
garage
at
first,
but
if
not,
you'll
need
to
find
a
manufacturer
who
can
produce
it
for
you.
Websites
like
alibaba.com
can
be
useful
for
identifying
overseas
manufacturers
with
experience
producing
products
that
are
similar
to
your
own
(and
for
double-checking
that
someone
else
isn't
already
making
it!)
Searching
the
web
for
"How
to
get
your
stuff
made
in
China"
actually
brings
up
several
detailed,
highly
useful
articles
on
the
subject.
There
are
also
companies
like
Neomek
that
you
can
hire
to
create
your
prototype
for
you,
and
do
initial
low-volume
manufacturing
(I've
never
used
them
myself,
so
don't
take
that
as
an
endorsement).
But
since
this
is
all
coming
out
of
your
own
pocket,
the
more
you
can
do
yourself,
the
better.
NAMING
YOUR
BUSINESS
You�re
now
at
the
point
where
your
business
needs
a
name.

Brainstorm
a
list
of
names
for
your
business
�
enlist
your
family
and
friends
for
this,
if
possible.
The
more
creative
minds
involved
the
better!
Remember,
no
judging
while
brainstorming.
Now
evaluate
your
list
of
potential
names.
Which
ones
are
the
easiest
to
remember?
The
most
important
aspect
of
your
name
is
that
your
customers
will
remember
it
once
they�ve
seen
it.

Things
that
are
hard
to
spell
are
probably
a
bad
idea.
Try
to
get
at
least
10
different
potential
good,
memorable
names
to
work
with.
The
next
part
is
to
find
names
you
can
actually
use.
Go
do
a
Google
search,
and
see
if
there
are
any
other
businesses
doing
something
similar
with
the
same
name.
If
so,
you
can�t
use
that
name!
Regardless
of
whether
they
registered
to
federal
trademark
protection,
trademarks
basically
belong
to
whoever
used
it
first
for
a
given
kind
of
business.
The
question
to
ask
yourself
is
�would
consumers
be
confused
between
these
two
businesses?�
If
so,
you�re
just
going
to
end
up
with
a
letter
from
a
lawyer
should
you
try
to
use
that
name.
If
your
business
is
web-based,
you�ll
now
need
to
see
if
you
can
find
an
available
Internet
domain
name
associated
with
your
business.
Website
hosting
companies
like
GoDaddy.com
make
it
easy
to
search
for
the
availability
of
a
given
domain
name
or
names
similar
to
it.
All
you
care
about
are
domains
that
end
in
.com
�
that
is
what
customers
will
type
in
when
they
are
trying
to
get
to
your
website.

Unfortunately,
a
lot
of
names
won�t
make
it
past
this
point
�
most
of
the
good
domain
names
are
taken.
You
might
be
able
to
use
some
sort
of
abbreviation
or
hyphenation
of
your
business
name,
so
try
a
few
variants.
Many
domains
are
owned
by
�domain
squatters�
who
just
hold
domain
names
hostage
for
a
fee.
If
there
is
no
real
website
associated
with
the
domain
you
want,
you
may
be
able
to
contact
the
owner
of
the
domain
to
see
what
they
want
for
it.
Be
prepared
for
a
high
number
in
most
cases
�
it�s
best
to
just
use
another
name.
OBTAINING
LICENSES
AND
TAX
PLANNING
You
don't
need
a
business
license
to
develop
a
prototype
on
your
own
time,
but
you
will
need
a
business
license
before
you
start
selling
it.
In
fact,
you'll
probably
need
several
of
them.
Now
that
your
business
has
a
name,
you
can
obtain
these
licenses.
Even
if
you
feel
you're
experienced
at
handling
government
paperwork,
I
encourage
you
to
invest
in
a
consultation
with
a
lawyer
who
specializes
in
small
businesses
to
get
your
new
company
set
up
properly.
I
was
cheap
and
set
up
a
Limited
Liability
Company
myself
with
the
state,
and
got
my
own
licenses
from
the
county
and
city.
It's
actually
not
hard
to
set
this
up
on
your
own,
but
it's
easy
to
make
the
wrong
choices.
An
LLC
may
offer
no
real
protection
to
you,
yet
cost
significantly
more
to
set
up
than
a
sole
proprietorship.
Splitting
the
company
50/50
with
your
spouse
may
seem
like
a
good
idea,
but
it
can
cause
big
problems
if
you
need
to
sell
your
company
later.
It
is
worth
a
few
hundred
dollars
to
involve
a
professional
to
determine
the
best
corporate
structure
for
your
new
business,
even
if
it
is
only
you.
Otherwise
you'll
just
end
up
paying
to
clean
up
your
mess
later
on,
like
I
did.
As
an
example,
here
are
the
fees
I
incurred
while
setting
up
my
business
in
Florida:
*
Setting
up
a
Limited
Liability
Company
with
the
state:
$125
*
�Business
Tax
Receipt�
handled
by
my
city,
which
also
handled
county
filing:
$82.50
Fees
vary
widely
by
state
and
municipality,
but
you�re
unlikely
to
need
more
than
$500
for
the
licenses
themselves.

Usually
state
licenses
can
be
obtained
over
the
web,
and
the
local
licenses
may
involve
a
phone
call
to
city
hall.
Certain
trades,
such
as
electricians,
require
additional
licenses
as
well.
If
you�re
using
a
lawyer,
they�ll
know
what
to
do
�
and
they
should
be
able
to
give
you
an
estimate
of
the
total
costs,
including
for
their
time,
as
part
of
a
free
initial
consultation.
If
you
have
chosen
to
set
up
your
US
company
as
some
sort
of
corporation
for
tax
purposes,
you
will
also
need
to
apply
for
a
Federal
Employer
Identification
Number
(FEIN)
at
this
point.
This
is
basically
a
social
security
number
for
a
business.
Your
lawyer
or
accountant
can
help
with
this,
or
you
can
apply
online
at
irs.gov.
Once
you
have
your
necessary
business
licenses,
you
can
go
open
a
checking
account
for
your
business.
Hopefully,
your
business
will
make
money
�
and
you'll
need
a
place
to
put
it!
It
will
be
important
to
keep
your
business
income
and
expenses
separate
from
your
personal
income
and
expenses
for
tax
purposes,
and
also
if
you
end
up
selling
your
business
at
some
point.
That
bank
account
is
a
must.
At
this
point,
it's
time
to
find
an
accountant.
If
your
business
involves
technology
or
any
sort
of
research
and
development,
I
recommend
finding
one
who
is
familiar
with
the
R&D
tax
credit
laws
if
you're
in
the
US.
Your
lawyer
helped
you
to
structure
your
company
from
a
business
standpoint,
but
you
might
structure
your
business
differently
from
a
tax
standpoint
�
and
that's
where
your
accountant's
advice
comes
in.
It
is
also
crucial
to
understand
your
new
tax
responsibilities
as
a
self-employed
individual.
Even
while
you
still
have
your
day
job,
any
money
your
side
business
earns
is
still
self-employment
income,
and
it
is
taxable.
You
may
need
to
pay
self-employment
tax
on
it,
and
you
will
almost
certainly
need
to
pay
estimated
taxes
each
quarter
based
on
it.
Depending
on
the
tax
structure
your
accountant
recommends,
you
might
even
be
paying
payroll
taxes
or
giving
yourself
a
paycheck
and
W2
forms.
Just
make
sure
your
initial
conversation
with
your
accountant
stresses
how
much
income
you
realistically
expect
to
earn
from
your
side
business
over
the
coming
year,
relative
to
your
paycheck
income
�
that
can
make
a
big
difference
on
the
strategy
you
initially
take.

Your
accountant
doesn�t
have
time
to
look
at
your
business
plan,
but
come
prepared
with
your
realistic
estimate
of
your
net
profit
in
the
first
tax
year.
If
you
plan
on
hiring
or
contracting
anyone
to
help
out
with
the
ongoing
development
of
your
business,
be
sure
your
accountant
knows
about
that
as
well.
You
will
have
reporting
requirements
to
the
IRS
about
money
you
spend
on
contractors
that
you
need
to
understand,
and
there
are
rules
about
who
can
be
considered
a
contractor
and
who
is
an
employee.
Finally,
you
need
to
be
tracking
all
of
your
expenses
and
income
related
to
your
business
somehow
�
almost
anything
you
spend
on
your
side
business
is
going
to
be
tax-deductible.
That
includes
deductions
for
space
in
your
home
used
exclusively
as
a
home
office,
business-related
travel
expenses
(including
trips
in
your
own
car,)
a
portion
of
any
utility
bills
or
house
repairs
for
your
house
that
contains
your
home
office,
and
more.
Talk
to
your
accountant
about
what
receipts
you
should
be
keeping,
and
how
to
keep
track
of
your
expenses
going
forward.
I
use
Quickbooks
Online
to
keep
track
of
my
bookkeeping.
It's
fairly
easy
to
use,
but
if
your
accountant
can
help
teach
you
how
to
use
it
properly,
it's
cheaper
to
do
that
now
than
to
pay
him
to
clean
up
your
books
at
tax
time
later
on.
An
accounting
package
such
as
Quickbooks
is
not
only
important
for
tax
purposes,
but
also
for
measuring
trends
in
your
business
and
cash
flow,
issuing
and
tracking
invoices,
and
other
activities
that
are
crucial
to
your
business.
You
must
take
the
time
to
become
familiar
with
Quickbooks
(or
something
like
it,
as
long
as
it�s
a
package
your
accountant
is
also
familiar
with)
before
you
spend
or
earn
a
penny
on
your
business.
LAUNCHING
YOUR
PRODUCT,
AND
MEASURING
THE
RESULTS
Building
a
great
product
in
your
spare
time
isn't
enough
�
it�s
worthless
until
you've
gotten
it
into
peoples'
hands!
You
want
some
validation
that
your
product
can
in
fact
generate
enough
revenue
to
live
on,
before
you
turn
in
your
notice.
That
means
you
need
to
launch
your
product
in
some
form
while
you're
still
employed,
and
measure
the
results.
A
launch
limited
to
a
small
market
is
probably
best;
you
don't
have
the
time
to
devote
to
a
big
splash,
and
you
can
apply
what
you've
learned
from
your
"soft
launch"
before
you
decide
to
go
big
with
your
product.
Can
you
identify
a
subset
of
the
market
for
your
product
�
one
where
you
know
what
percentage
of
the
total
market
they
represent?
Perhaps
a
limited
geographic
area
or
customers
that
visit
a
single
website
or
mailing
list
you
plan
to
announce
your
product
on?
The
idea
is
to
measure
the
response
from
this
test
market,
and
then
extrapolate
those
results
to
a
larger
market.
Before
launching,
understand
how
you
will
measure
the
success
of
your
launch,
and
define
what
you
consider
success
to
be.
It's
very
tempting
to
start
spinning
your
metrics
in
a
positive
light
after
you've
launched
your
product,
so
define
ahead
of
time
what
you'll
measure
and
where
that
measurement
needs
to
be
before
you'll
turn
in
your
notice.
I'll
make
this
easy
for
you
�
the
only
measurement
that
matters
is
how
much
money
your
product
is
making.
How
many
people
visited
your
website
does
not
matter
�
at
this
stage,
most
of
them
are
probably
bots
or
people
clicking
on
your
ads
by
mistake
anyhow.
It's
good
to
understand
trends
on
your
website
through
Google
Analytics
or
similar
tools,
but
these
website
metrics
can
be
very
distracting
and
misleading
if
you
don't
understand
them
deeply
enough.
How
many
people
use
a
free
version
of
your
product
also
does
not
matter.
These
metrics
maybe
mean
something
in
your
day
job
at
a
larger
company,
but
when
it's
your
livelihood
on
the
line,
all
that
matters
is
the
profit
you
make.
I
said
profit,
not
revenue.
If
you
earn
$10,000
from
your
initial
launch,
but
it
cost
$11,000
to
manufacture
the
products
you
sold
�
you
lose.
(A
nuance
here
is
the
concept
of
fixed
versus
variable
costs
�
what
you
care
about
is
how
much
money
your
business
can
generate
on
its
own
in
the
long
run.
Costs
you
sunk
into
product
development
are
a
one-time,
variable
expense,
and
so
you
wouldn't
count
those
against
your
revenue
when
calculating
profit
for
these
purposes.
Ongoing,
fixed
expenses
such
as
the
cost
of
producing
your
goods,
or
the
cost
of
advertising
and
web
hosting
needed
to
produce
those
sales,
would
count.)
If
that
previous
paragraph
confused
you,
you
might
consider
taking
a
course
from
your
local
community
college
or
an
online
course
on
the
basics
of
accounting.
It
can
be
helpful
when
trying
to
understand
if
your
business
is
sustainable
or
not,
and
it
helps
you
to
talk
the
same
language
with
your
accountant.
Let's
say
you
plan
on
launching
your
product
to
a
test
market
that
represents
10%
of
your
total
market,
and
you
need
to
earn
$10,000
per
month
(pre-tax)
to
maintain
your
standard
of
living.
Your
goal
then
is
to
earn
at
least
$1,000
in
net
profit
during
the
first
month.
If
you
don't,
then
you're
not
ready
to
quit
your
job
yet.
It
doesn't
necessarily
mean
you
give
up
�
but
you
may
need
to
spend
more
time
refining
your
product
offering
in
order
to
grow
your
profit
to
the
point
it
needs
to
be.
If
you're
a
little
short,
that
might
be
OK
�
you
are
only
giving
this
business
a
part-time
effort
at
this
point,
and
it's
pretty
safe
to
say
that
it
will
be
more
successful
once
you
dedicate
your
full-time
attention
to
It.
Understanding
your
success
metrics
is
only
one
part
of
your
launch
plan.
How
will
you
announce
your
product
launch?
You
can't
just
build
it,
and
hope
they'll
come.
Putting
up
a
website
about
your
product
will
accomplish
nothing,
unless
you
have
a
plan
for
driving
traffic
to
it.
Will
you
post
on
forums
and
mailing
lists
(in
a
tactful
way
that
doesn't
sound
sales-ey?)
Will
you
publish
to
social
networks,
LinkedIn
groups,
and
the
like?
Will
you
issue
a
press
release
�
and
if
so,
which
editors
will
you
send
it
to?
Will
you
pay
for
some
online
targeted
advertising
to
drive
some
initial
traffic
to
your
product's
website?
If
so,
how
much,
and
with
whom?
How
will
you
optimize
your
site
for
search
engine
placement?
What
will
you
do
post-launch?
How
will
you
handle
customer
support?
If
you
anticipate
a
lot
of
it,
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
take
a
week
of
vacation
time
from
your
day
job
during
your
initial
launch
until
you
can
get
a
handle
on
it.
Don't
give
up
too
easily.
Odds
are
you'll
learn
that
your
product
requires
more
refinement
once
you
start
getting
feedback
from
real
customers.
If
it's
something
that's
hurting
sales,
go
ahead
and
iterate
on
your
product
offering
and
see
if
it
translates
into
better
sales.
Your
initial
customers
might
even
have
ideas
on
new
markets
you
can
sell
your
product
into.
Even
if
the
revenue
stream
you
initially
create
isn't
enough
to
quit
your
day
job
�
it�s
still
extra
revenue!
As
long
as
you
feel
the
return
you're
getting
is
worth
the
time
you're
putting
into
it,
continuing
your
side
business
without
quitting
your
job
is
still
an
option.
And,
you
may
find
that
it
organically
grows
over
time
to
a
business
that
does
let
you
quit
your
day
job
in
the
future.
Bear
in
mind
too
that
whatever
publicity
you
created
for
your
initial
result
will
probably
result
in
an
initial
burst
of
sales
that
quickly
dies
down.
This
is
normal,
so
don't
measure
your
results
over
too
long
of
a
period
at
first.
If
you
do
decide
to
double-down
on
this
new
business,
then
you'll
be
creating
an
ongoing
marketing
strategy
to
keep
your
level
of
sales
more
steady.
Also
think
about
the
sales
cycle
of
your
product.
A
big-ticket
item
may
take
months
to
sell,
while
prospective
customers
evaluate
it
and
obtain
the
necessary
budget
to
purchase
it.
Such
items
will
require
more
time
to
measure
success.
A
very
good
sign
is
if
your
customers
start
recommending
your
product
to
others,
leading
to
sales
growth
even
after
your
initial
launch
push.
As
scary
as
it
may
be,
monitor
Internet
forums
where
you
have
announced
your
product,
and
look
for
feedback.
Search
the
web
for
mentions
of
your
new
product
and
see
if
it�s
being
recommended.
If
you
are
selling
your
product
through
an
online
storefront,
how
are
the
reviews?
These
are
all
ways
that
word
of
mouth
works
on
the
Internet,
and
it�s
a
very
important
growth
channel
that
you
must
monitor
and
address.
Services
such
as
Google
Alerts
can
help
keep
you
informed
of
how
your
product
is
being
received
online.
Keep
in
mind
that
any
creative
endeavor
you
release
publicly
will
be
met
with
some
degree
of
hate
online,
no
matter
how
good
it
is.
There
are
a
lot
of
kids
on
the
Internet
who
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
try
to
make
as
many
people
feel
bad
about
themselves
as
possible,
and
who
will
post
harsh
criticism
of
anything
they
encounter,
regardless
of
its
merit.

Their
comments
are
rarely
constructive.
The
best
thing
you
can
do
is
ignore
them,
although
that's
very
hard
to
do
at
first.
You
must
resist
the
temptation
to
give
them
the
attention
they're
seeking
by
reacting
to
their
inflammatory
comments.
If
your
product
does
have
merit,
you'll
often
find
that
others
come
to
your
defense
on
your
behalf.
Just
be
thankful
that
your
product
launch
was
big
enough
to
get
noticed
by
Internet
trolls!
That
in
itself
is
an
accomplishment.
In
the
end,
it's
not
online
comments
that
matter;
it's
the
people
who
vote
with
their
wallets
by
purchasing
your
product.
If
comments
are
overwhelmingly
negative,
that
will
affect
your
sales
�
but
if
nobody's
coming
to
your
defense
against
the
trolls,
perhaps
your
product
does
in
fact
require
refinement.
That's
why
we
launched
to
a
test
market
�
so
the
damage
from
an
inadequate
product
offering
would
be
constrained,
and
you
can
still
try
again.
Finally,
remember
you're
still
keeping
your
business
quiet
among
your
peers
at
this
stage.
When
publicizing
your
initial
launch,
don't
release
anything
publicly
that
ties
you
personally
to
the
business,
or
can
be
used
to
personally
identify
you
or
where
you
live.
Even
after
you
quit
your
day
job
and
"come
out,"
this
sort
of
information
should
be
kept
private.
Those
Internet
trolls
I
mentioned
have
been
known
to
do
things
as
silly
as
placing
pizza
delivery
orders
to
the
home
addresses
of
their
targets,
or
as
scary
as
sending
SWAT
teams
to
your
house
for
an
alleged
hostage
situation.
It's
best
to
keep
your
personal
identity
entirely
separate
from
your
business.
YOUR
PERSONAL
RISK
MITIGATION
PLAN
So
you
created
a
product
and
launched
it
in
your
spare
time,
and
its
initial
sales
are
encouraging?
Congratulations!
Seriously,
treat
yourself
to
a
night
out
�
you�ve
got
a
lot
to
be
proud
of.
But
you're
not
ready
to
turn
in
your
notice
quite
yet.
There's
a
lot
that
can
still
go
wrong,
and
you
need
to
have
a
backup
plan
in
place.
Maybe
you
have
a
higher
risk
tolerance
than
I
do,
but
remember
in
the
US
you
have
no
safety
net
as
an
entrepreneur.
If
your
business
goes
bust,
you
cannot
collect
unemployment
benefits12
�
you�re
entirely
on
your
own.
Having
a
backup
plan
in
place
really
is
crucial.
